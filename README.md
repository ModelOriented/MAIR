# MAIR

This project aims to monitor emerging regulations that have an impact on the creation and usage of solutions that are based on AI. Our goal is to create a comprehensive database of AI regulations from different regions, and research papers regarding issues which should be regulated, analyze possible consequences of such regulations, and build tools to run such analysis automatically.

Initial results were presented on a [MLinPL conference poster](AI_regulations_MLinPL.pdf).

# Project structure

- `data` directory contains raw and processed regulations and papers.
- `scripts` directory containts runnable processing pipeline steps.
- `mair` directory contains python modules used in processing pipeline.
- `notebooks` directory contains notebooks with PoC versions of pipeline steps, and analysis.

# Contributing

If you know any documents that are related to AI regulations and should be on this list, or have any suggestions, you can open an issue on this GitHub repository.

# Documents regarding AI regulations

The list is split into 2 parts. In the first part there non-formal documents from governments, describing intentions and directions of regulations. The second part consists of formalized regulations or regulations proposals.
