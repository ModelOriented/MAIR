The  right  to  the  protection  of  personal data  is  not  an  absolute  right;  it  must  be  considered  in  relation  to  its  function  in  society  and  be  balanced  against other  fundamental  rights,  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of  proportionality.  This  Regulation  respects  all fundamental  rights  and  observes  the  freedoms  and  principles  recognised  in  the  Charter  as  enshrined  in  the Treaties,  in  particular  the  respect  for  private  and  family  life,  home  and  communications,  the  protection  of personal  data,  freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and  religion,  freedom  of  expression  and  information,  freedom  to conduct  a  business,  the  right  to  an  effective  remedy  and  to  a  fair  trial,  and  cultural,  religious  and  linguistic diversity. The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of  the internal market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border  flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including  natural  persons,  associations  and  undertakings  across  the  Union  has  increased.  National  authorities  in the  Member  States  are  being  called  upon  by Union law to cooperate and  exchange personal  data  so  as  to be  able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State. Rapid  technological  developments  and  globalisation  have  brought  new  challenges  for  the  protection  of  personal data.  The  scale  of  the  collection  and  sharing  of  personal  data  has  increased  significantly.  Technology  allows  both private  companies  and  public  authorities  to  make  use  of  personal  data  on  an  unprecedented  scale  in  order  to pursue  their  activities.  Natural  persons  increasingly  make  personal  information  available  publicly  and  globally.
