In response, the research field of algorithmic fairness has\\nemerged. This rapidly evolving research area is focused on devel-\\noping tools and techniques with aspirations to make development,\\nuse, and resulting impact of algorithmic systems conform to various\\nsocial and legal notions of fairness. The concept of fairness, in ad-\\ndition to being situational, evolving, and contested from a number\\nof philosophical and legal traditions, can only be understood in\\nreference to the different social groups that constitute the organi-\\nzation of society. Consequently, the vast majority of algorithmic\\nfairness frameworks are specified with reference to these social\\ngroups, often requiring a formal encoding of the groups into the\\ndataset and/or algorithm.\\n', 'However, most social groups relevant to fairness analysis re-\\nflect highly contextual and unstable social constructs. These social\\ngroups are often defined with recourse to legal anti-discrimination\\nconcepts such as \"protected classes,\" which, in the US, refers to race,\\ncolor, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. However, the\\nprocess of drawing boundaries around distinct social groups for\\nfairness research is fraught; the construction of categories has a\\nlong history of political struggle and legal argumentation.\\n', 'Numerous recent works have highlighted the limitations of cur-\\nrent algorithmic fairness frameworks [53, 108]. Several of these\\ncritiques point to the tendency to abstract away critical social and\\nhistorical contexts and minimize the structural conditions that un-\\nderpin problems of algorithmic unfairness. We build on this critical\\nresearch, focusing specifically on the use of race and racial cate-\\ngories within this field. IN this literature, the topic of the instability\\nof racial categories has gone relative unexplored, with the notable\\nexception of Benthall and Haynes [12], which we discuss in detail\\nbelow.\\n', 'Race is a major axis around which algorithmic allocation of\\nresources and representation is bound. It may indeed be the most\\nsignificant axis, given attention by investigative journalists (e.g. [7])\\nand critical race and technology scholars (e.g. [11, 20, 21, 24, 85]).\\n'], ['FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\n', 'Hanna et al.\\n', 'Because of this, it is imperative that the race-based methodologies\\nand racial categories themselves are interrogated and critically\\nevaluated.\\n', 'In this paper we develop several lines of critique directed at the\\ntreatment of race within algorithmic fairness methodologies. In\\nshort, we observe that current methodologies fail to adequately\\naccount for the socially constructed nature of race, instead adopting\\na conceptualization of race as a fixed attribute. This manifests in the\\nwidespread use of racial categories as if they represent natural and\\nobjective differences between groups. Treating race as an attribute,\\nrather than a structural, institutional, and relational phenomenon,\\nin turn serves to minimize the structural aspects of algorithmic\\nunfairness.\\n', 'The process of operationalizing race is fundamentally a project\\nof racial classification and thus must be understood as a political\\nproject, or, more specifically, what Omi and Winant [86] refer to\\nas a racial project. The tools for measuring individual characteris-\\ntics, such as national censuses and other population-level survey\\ninstruments, were and are still often based in the politics of racial\\noppression and domination. While we acknowledge the importance\\nof measuring race for the purposes of understanding patterns of\\ndifferential performance or differentially adverse impact of algo-\\nrithmic systems, in this work, we emphasize that data collection\\nand annotation efforts must be grounded in the social and historical\\ncontexts of racial classification and racial category formation. To\\noversimplify is to do violence, or even more, to re-inscribe violence\\non communities that already experience structural violence.\\n', 'It is useful to distinguish between two ways in which race comes\\ninto play in algorithmic fairness research: (i) the operationalization\\nof race, i.e. the process of converting the abstract concept of race\\ninto something that is concrete and measurable and (ii) the use of\\nracial variables within algorithmic frameworks. These aspects are\\ntightly interconnected since race must be operationalized before\\nracial variables can be utilized.\\n', 'Our contributions are as follows: we review the use of race in\\nprior fairness work and discuss an intervention in the debate on\\nracial categories. We then survey the history of racial classifica-\\ntion, scientific racism, and racial classification in national censuses.\\nWe introduce the notion of multidimensionality of race, and sub-\\nsequently review how different disciplines have dealt with the\\ntricky problem of operationalizing race, most notably in biomedical,\\nsurvey, and public health research. In light of these discussions,\\nwe address how race has been treated in the group fairness and\\ndisaggregated analysis paradigms. Lastly, we argue that fairness re-\\nsearchers need to take into account the multidimensionality of race,\\ntake seriously the processes of conceptualizing and operationaliz-\\ning race, focus on processes of racism, and consider perspectives of\\nthose most affected by sociotechnical systems.\\n', '2 THE PROBLEM WITH RACIAL\\n', 'CATEGORIES\\n', 'In perhaps the best-known debate surrounding algorithmic fair-\\nness, Julia Angwin and her colleagues illustrated the differing rates\\nat which Black defendants had been issued high pre-trial risk as-\\nsessment scores by the COMPAS recidivism prediction algorithm\\ncompared to white defendants [7]. Equivant – then, Northpointe,\\n', 'the company which developed COMPAS – defended the system\\nby reanalyzing the ProPublica data [28] and ProPublica later re-\\nsponded [6]. The debate has become a cornerstone of algorithmic\\nfairness research; to date, the original story has some 700 citations\\non Google Scholar.\\n', 'The Propublica analysis of COMPAS, as well as the responses\\nfrom Northpointe and other secondary analyses performed by third-\\nparty researchers, relied on data from the Broward County Sheriff’s\\nOffice which was obtained through a public records request. Race\\nclassifications in this data identified defendants as Black, White,\\nHispanic, Asian, Native American or Other. These categories look\\nfamiliar – they are nearly identical to the way that the US Census\\ndefines race. However, there are the notable absences of the cate-\\ngories \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\", and there is a\\nredefinition of \"Hispanic\" as a race rather than an ethnicity.\\n', 'In the methodological appendix to the original article [69], Jeff\\nLarson and other ProPublica authors do not delve into how the\\nrace of the defendant is measured. Larson admits that he did not\\nknow how Broward County classified individuals 1. It’s not clear\\nwhy Broward County used the modified Census racial schema,\\nbut, as detailed below, it may have to do with a 1977 directive\\nfrom the federal US Office of Management and Budget. In general,\\napproaches to measuring race for police records are inconsistent\\nacross municipalities. They can rely on self-identification, state\\nrecords, or observation by criminal justice workers. In her work on\\nracial disparities in incarceration in Wisconsin, sociologist Pamela\\nOliver notes that the race of a single individual can change across\\nrecords even within a single jurisdiction 2. Therefore, even in the\\nmost famous debate of the field, we don’t know why the data take\\non a particular racial schema, nor do we have information about\\nhow defendants are racially categorized.\\n', '2.1 Using race-like categories?\\nWhile an area of major concern for critical race and technology\\nscholarship, the use of racial categories in algorithmic fairness re-\\nsearch (i.e. the research community which has emerged around\\nvenues like FAT* and AIES) has largely gone unquestioned. There\\nare two important exceptions. First, in the original Gender Shades\\npaper which helped establish intersectional testing, Buolamwini\\nand Gebru note the instability of race and ethnicity labels, which\\njustifies their use of skin tone [22]. Second, the critique levied by\\ncomputational social scientist Sebastian Benthall and critical race\\nscholar Bruce D. Haynes [12] describes how little attention has\\nbeen given to the meaning of protected class labels, the political\\norientation of class labels, and the normative assumptions of ma-\\nchine learning design. They focus on the typical referent group\\n– African-Americans in the US – and discuss how \"racial classi-\\nfication is embedded in state institutions, and reinforced in civil\\nsociety in ways that are relevant to the design of machine learning\\nsystems.\" Race is invoked because \"racial classification signifies\\nsocial, economic, and political inequities anchored in state and civic\\ninstitutional practices.\"\\n', 'We wholly agree with their overall argument, which is that\\nalgorithmic fairness research has been largely silent on the issues\\n', '1Personal correspondence, Jeff Larson, August 19, 2019.\\n2Personal correspondence, Pamela Oliver, August 19, 2019.\\n', '502\\n'], ['Towards a Critical Race Methodology in Algorithmic Fairness\\n', 'FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\n', 'of racial statistics and categories, and that in that silence, has thus\\nreified them. In their criticism of the COMPAS debate, we echo\\ntheir argument:\\n', 'rather than taking racial statistics... at face value, the\\nprocess that generates them and the process through\\nwhich they are interpreted should be analyzed with\\nthe same rigor and skepticism as the recidivism pre-\\ndiction algorithm. Thematically, we argue that racial\\nbias is far more likely to come from human judgments\\nin data generation and interpretation than from an al-\\ngorithmic model, and that this has broad implications\\nfor fairness in machine learning [12, pp. 291].\\n', 'We diverge from their critique, not necessarily in their problem\\nformation, but in their solution. They offer up a narrow path to\\nfollow which plots a course between the Scylla of \"[m]achines\\nthat ... [reify] racial categories that are inherent unfair\" and the\\nCharybdis of \"systems that allocate resources in ways that are\\nblind to race [which] will reproduce racial inequality in society\"\\n[12, pp. 294]. In their solution, they propose using an unsupervised\\nmachine learning method to create race-like categories which aim to\\naddress \"historical racial segregation with reproducing the political\\nconstruction of racial categories.\" One virtue of this method is that\\nit is attentive to creating a metric which makes sense with respect\\nto a particular social inequality, that is, spatial segregation. This is\\nsomething we agree with in our adoption of a multidimensional\\nperspective below.\\n', 'We’d like to raise a few complexities in their formulation which\\nmake us hesitant to adopt their solution. First, it would be a grave\\nerror to supplant the existing categories of race with race-like\\ncategories inferred by unsupervised learning methods. Despite the\\nrisk of reifying the socially constructed idea called race, race does\\nexist in the world, as a way of mental sorting, as a discourse which is\\nadopted, as a social thing which has both structural and ideological\\ncomponents. In other words, although race is social constructed,\\nrace still has power. To supplant race with race-like categories for\\nthe purposes of measurement sidesteps the problem.\\n', 'Second, supplanting race with race-like categories depends highly\\non context, namely how race operates within particular systems\\nof inequality and domination. Benthall and Haynes restrict their\\nanalysis to that of spatial segregation, which is to be sure, an im-\\nportant and active research area and subject of significant policy\\ndiscussion (e.g. [76, 99]). However, that metric may appear illegi-\\nble to analyses pertaining to other racialized institutions, such as\\nthe criminal justice system, education, or employment (although\\none can readily see their connections and interdependencies). The\\nway that race matters or pertains to particular types of structural\\ninequality depends on that context and requires its own modes of\\noperationalization.\\n', 'Third, and relatedly, as Wendy Chun and Ruha Benjamin have\\ndiscussed [11, 24], race operates both with and as technology. At the\\nsame time we focus on the ontological aspects of race (what is race,\\nhow is it constituted and imagined in the world), it is necessary to\\npay attention to what we do with race and measures which may be\\ninterpreted as race. The creation of metrics and indicators which\\nare race-like will still be interpreted as race. As we discuss more\\nbelow, the example of genomics research is indicative. Even as\\n', 'genomics researchers warn not to interpret genetic ancestry as race\\nor ethnicity [15, 122], this has not prevented people (e.g. customers\\nof direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies) from interpreting\\nthem as such [98].\\n', 'Finally, we’d like to underline the infrastructural criticism embed-\\nded in the act of categorization itself. By infrastructure, we refer to\\nthe way that classifications and standards form the infrastructure of\\nour existing information society [17]. Inverting infrastructures and\\nseeking their fissures allows us to understand how they are used\\nin practice and how politics are embedded in their creation. This\\npoint dovetails with the critiques levied by abolitionist activists,\\nscholars, and technologists [1, 9, 11]. J. Khadijah Abdurahman [1]\\nargues that to study algorithmic fairness is to sidestep the problem\\nbeyond the algorithmic frame, that we, with communities who are\\ndisproportionally affected by redlining, predictive policing, and\\nsurveillance, should not just contest how \"protected classes within\\nalgorithms are generated-but [should] viscerally reject the notion\\nhuman beings should be placed in cages in the first place.\" The task\\nof using racial classifications at all requires us to expand the frame\\nto consider what the larger implications of classifying are. Who is\\ndoing the classifying? For what purpose are they classifying and to\\nwhat end?\\n', '3 HISTORIES OF RACIAL CATEGORIZATION\\nWe recount histories of racial category construction by administra-\\ntive and scientific bodies as a means of highlighting the decidedly\\nsocial constructivist notion of race. As Hacking [48] has said, social\\nconstructivism is the act of \"making up people.\" Social construction\\ndoes not mean that things in the world are not \"real\" [31], but that\\nthat thing – be it a racial, gender, or class category – was brought\\ninto existence or shaped by historical events, social forces, political\\npower, and/or colonial conquest, all of which could have been very\\ndifferent. When we demonstrate that something is socially con-\\nstructed, it becomes clear that it could be constructed differently,\\nand then we can start to demand changes in it [48, pp. 6-7].\\n', 'Race as a concept is widely acknowledged by the social sciences\\nto be a social construction. In the racial formation framework, Omi\\nand Winant [86] discuss how race is both real and socially con-\\nstructed. The social constructedness of race decenters the concept\\nas a property of individuals determined by phenotypical properties.\\nInstead, social constructivism places race within specific history\\nand context. The constructedness of race in any given point in time\\nis tied to the specific racial project. A racial project is \"simultane-\\nously an interpretation, representation, or explanation of racial\\nidentities and meanings, and an effort to organize and distribute re-\\nsources (economic, political, cultural) along particular racial lines\"\\n[86, pp. 56]. Those racial projects can range in scale and kind, in\\nthe microinteractional to the structural.\\n', 'Race is not something that arrived whole cloth, but needed to be\\nmade up. Race, although socially constructed, of course has very\\nsalient material effects. Accordingly, the most modern understand-\\ning of race argues that it is inauthentic to conceptualize race as a\\nnatural property of individuals. The \"naturalization\" of race and\\nracial categories do not come from nowhere. It has been constructed\\nand been continually reproduced as part of a project of upholding\\n', '503\\n'], ['FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\n', 'Hanna et al.\\n', 'a particular type of racial project – one that is historically and cul-\\nturally bound. Historian Ibram X. Kendi, for instance, thoroughly\\noutlines the history of race and racial projects from 15-century\\nEurope to the present [64]. Projects that \"misrecognize\" race as\\nnatural [27] are driven by the hegemonic nature of racial projects\\n[86]. It would be more accurate to describe race as relational and as\\na property of institutions, organizations, and larger structures [93].\\nRace may be more accurately discussed as having relational quali-\\nties, with dimensions that are symbolic or based on phenotype, but\\nthat are also contingent on specific social and historical contexts.\\n', '3.1 Classification and the Racial History of\\n', 'Social Statistics\\n', 'Classification is a process imbued with social, economic, and orga-\\nnizational imperatives [17, 38]. Those who do the categorizing have\\ntheir own institutional and occupational priorities. Categories them-\\nselves become a type of infrastructure: they are the ground upon\\nwhich other structural and ideational elements are built. When they\\nwork, they are invisible, but when they break down, the boundaries\\nand assumptions begin to show. With the development of markets\\nand the rise of technological innovation and actuarial science, classi-\\nfication of individuals has moved from the more general assessment\\nbased on subgroup distinction to individuation based on market\\nimperatives.\\n', 'Although in the modern neoliberal era, markets have been an\\nemerging force in categorization and segmentation [39], the en-\\ntity tasked with categorization above all others has been the state.\\nAlmost as soon as humans began living in agriculturally-based\\ncommunities, it became necessary to count the number of people\\nliving under the control of a certain party [107]. Categorization was\\nalso used to streamline counting items of like type – such as trees\\nin a forest, grain, or human beings. Further, since early grain-based\\nagriculture necessitated vast numbers of essentially slave-laborers,\\nrulers needed to know how many slaves there were and moreover,\\nwho counted as a slave. As Scott argues, during the agricultural\\nrevolution there was initially strong resistance to transitioning\\nfrom life as a hunter-gatherer to a more hierarchical, regimented,\\nand predictable existence as a slave harvesting grain and to \"being\\ncounted\" by newly-created states [107].\\n', 'The modern discipline of statistics grew out of a bureaucratic\\nneed to manage large populations and natural resources [52]. More\\nspecifically and perniciously, the field of social statistics emerged\\nfrom the need to make differentiations between white Europeans\\nand their descendants, and other peoples. Francis Galton was a\\nmajor figure in the development of social statistics; he was also a\\neugenicist and a major proponent of using statistics as a means to\\njustify racial superiority of European-origin peoples [16, 124, 125].\\nAs Galton writes in his Hereditary Genius:\\n', 'The natural ability of which this book mainly treats,\\nis such as a modern European possesses in a much\\ngreater average share than men of the lower races.\\nThere is nothing either in the history of domestic\\nanimals or in that evolution to make us doubt that\\na race of sane men may be formed, who shall be as\\nmuch superior mentally and morally to the modern\\n', '504\\n', 'European as the modern European is to the lowest of\\nthe Negro races (quoted in [124]).\\n', 'The practice of racial classification that emerged in social sta-\\ntistics is closely tied to the project of nation-building, in multiple\\nsenses. In the first case, racial classification was a prerequisite to\\nthe project of European colonization of the Americas. The racial-\\nization of chattel slavery is a modern phenomenon. European colo-\\nnial projects developed alongside Enlightenment ideas of liberal\\ndemocracy. Creating structures of racial stratification necessitated\\nideational components that would legitimate the enslavement of\\nAfricans [125]. Until the early 20th century in the West and the\\nrise of cultural anthropologists such as Franz Boas, there was wide-\\nspread support for eugenics and scientific racism, and the belief\\nthat the state must intervene to protect the physical and mental\\ncharacteristics of the white race. In 1926, 23 of 48 states had laws\\npermitting sterilization [106]. At the height of miscegenation leg-\\nislation (that is, laws against marriages which were \"interracial\"\\nor \"cross-cultural\" in nature), 41 American colonies and states had\\nlaws against the practice [88]. As the project of nation-building\\n(more specifically, colonization of non-European nations) waned in\\nthe 1960s, so did the popularity of eugenics as a scientific practice.\\nHowever, as Syed Mustafa Ali notes, the scientific racism under-\\ngirding colonialism has persisted as \"‘sedimented’ ways of knowing\\nand being – based on systems of categorisation, classification, and\\ntaxonomisation and the ways that these are manifested in practices,\\nartefacts and technologies\" [2]. Technologies of racial classification,\\nsuch as blood quantum for Native Americans, persist and upon lega-\\ncies of settler colonialism. These technologies become enshrined in\\nfolk understandings of racial percentages, such as genetic ancestry\\n[113], or in law, as blood quantum remains a legal requisite to tribal\\nmembership, tribal constitution, and land claims.\\n', 'Second, since the founding of the Americas, delineating racial\\nboundaries has been part and parcel of the state-building project.\\nAssessing and evaluating racial and ethnic boundaries is a state\\npractice that coincides not only with a cultural understanding of\\nwho belongs to the polity, but has and continually is a prerequisite\\nfor formal citizenship in many countries. In the pre-war United\\nStates, appeals to citizenship for non-native born residents were\\nfundamentally appeals to whiteness. Lopez documents how appeals\\nto whiteness and the boundaries of the category of whiteness flexed\\nand contracted in legal argumentation [73]. The 1790 Naturalization\\nAct restricted citizenship to \"any alien, being a free white person\"\\nwho had been in the United States for at least two years. It wasn’t\\nuntil the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952\\nthat the explicit racialized nature of naturalization was restricted,\\nalthough the Act laid the groundwork for the current restrictive\\nrace-based ratio system which exists today. Maghbouleh demon-\\nstrates how, prior to 1952, Iranians could be used as a \"racial hinge\"\\nto argue both for and against claims to whiteness, and how citi-\\nzenship claims critically depended on who could make this claim\\n[75].\\n', 'Third, national censuses are a critical component of state ma-\\nchinery. State enumeration of populations works to facilitate the\\nadministrative and bureaucratic functions of the modern nation-\\nstate. As Scott points out:\\n'], ['Towards a Critical Race Methodology in Algorithmic Fairness\\n', 'FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\n', 'State simplifications such as maps, censuses, cadastral\\nlists, and standard units of measurement represent\\ntechniques for grasping a large and complex reality;\\nin order for officials to be able to comprehend aspects\\nof the ensemble, that complex reality must be reduced\\nto schematic categories. The only way to accomplish\\nthis is to reduce an infinite array of detail to a set of\\ncategories that will facilitate summary descriptions,\\ncomparisons, and aggregation. The invention, elabora-\\ntion, and deployment of these abstractions represent,\\nas Charles Tilly [116] has shown, an enormous leap\\nin state capacity – a move from tribute and indirect\\nrule to taxation and direct rule [106, pp. 77].\\n', 'Furthermore, censuses not only quantify members of racial so-\\ncial groups, but also create and constitute the boundaries of these\\nsocial groups themselves. Melissa Nobles outlines how racial classifi-\\ncations are taken for granted by policymakers, but how national\\ncensuses not only enumerate polity members into racial categories,\\nbut also help to reinscribe racial categories themselves, that is,\\n\"[c]ensus-taking is one of the institutional mechanisms by which\\nracial boundaries are set\" [112, pp. xi]. In the US, the national census\\nis the sole basis for which representation is guaranteed in the House\\nof Representatives and the Electoral College. In the antebellum US,\\nthe Three-Fifths Compromise, in which Black slaves were counted\\nas three-fifths of a human for the purposes of appropriation and\\ntaxation, is the most dramatic example of racial classification in\\ncounting populations. Whereas the passage of the 14th Amendment\\nguaranteed all Americans being counted as a whole person regard-\\nless of race, racial categories defined in the Census in the latter part\\nof the 19th Century reflected fractional referents to Black racial lin-\\neage based in the ascendant movement of eugenics and race science\\nmentioned above. Categories of \"octoroon\" and \"quadroon\", along\\nwith \"mulatto\" denoted fractional heredities of the Black population\\n[112].\\n', 'Because of the allocative nature of census-taking and the bureau-\\ncracies associated with the practice, what goes into the census is\\npolitically contested by mobilizing racial and ethnic groups. The\\npolitical contestation of the census has been laid bare recently with\\nthe attempted introduction of a citizenship question into the US\\nCensus and its potential for its dampening effects on participation\\nby Latinx groups [72]. For instance, after the 1950 Census, in light\\nof the discoveries of dramatic undercounts of non-white popula-\\ntions and with rising pressures from the Civil Rights Movement,\\nthe 1960 Census shifting from interview identification to asking\\nindividuals to self-identify their race. As Snipp rightly points out,\\nthis procedural change was a \"fundamental redefinition of race.\"\\nPopulation statistics formerly based on phenotypical appearances\\nwere now based on \"cultural affiliation and other deeply held per-\\nsonal considerations beyond the pale of conventional demographic\\ninquiry\" [112, pp. 570]. This shift was not only bureaucratic but\\nalso (perhaps unknowingly by the Census Bureau) ontological: race\\nas measured by the Census aligned more with the social construc-\\ntionism and less with essentialism. The Office of Management and\\nBudget (OMB) Directive No. 15 of 1977 instituted a standard in\\nracial classifications used by government agencies and developed a\\nstandard for five distinct groups: (a) American Indians and Alaska\\n', 'Natives, (b) Asian and Pacific Islanders, (c) Non-Hispanic Blacks, (d)\\nNon-Hispanic Whites, and (e) Hispanics. The impact of this direc-\\ntive had far-reaching implications, as this categorization \"permeated\\nevery level of government, many if not most large corporations,\\nand many other institutions such as schools and nonprofit orga-\\nnizations\" ([87], cited in [112]). The 1997 revision of Directive No.\\n15 separated out Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, set\\nHispanics and Latinos apart as an ethnic group (rather than a racial\\ngroup), and allowed respondents to provide multiple responses to\\nracial heritage [112].\\n', 'Dramatic changes in governance have large downstream effects\\nfor the accuracy of census counts and their categories. Khalfani et\\nal. document the differences between the South African numbers\\nbefore and after the reign of Mandela’s African National Congress,\\nand find that the raw counts and the estimations from aerial pho-\\ntography both dramatically undercount the majority African popu-\\nlations, as well as women [65]. The US Census Bureau spends a non-\\ntrivial amount of effort getting enumeration correct for marginal-\\nized groups; however, those efforts can be stymied with the winds of\\npartisanship and political administration. Even without the issues\\nraised by a potential citizenship question, decreased or flat-lined\\nfunding has left the Census Bureau understaffed and unable to\\nthoroughly test new methodologies [32].\\n', 'In sum, the act of classification cannot be divorced from the\\ngroup who is doing the classification and the organizational and\\ninstitutional pressures of performing classification. Racial classifi-\\ncation has a long history within quantitative social science, and,\\nin some ways, is the reason that social statistics have developed\\nthe way they did. That history is grounded in eugenicist thought\\nand practice, and much of that work provided the infrastructure\\nfor census-taking in the US, Canada, Latin America, and South\\nAfrica. More expansive categorization resulted from social and po-\\nlitical movements in those countries. In short, categorization itself\\nis a technological infrastructure within which institutional racism\\ncontinues to reside. In this way, we can realize the ways in which\\nrace intersects with technology but also as a technology in and\\nof itself. The framing of race as technology shifts the terrain of\\nthe discussion – rather, from what race is and how we can classify\\nindividuals, to what we can do with race and how to make it do\\ndifferent (and explicitly anti-racist) things.\\n', '3.2 The multidimensionality of race\\nAs highlighted by the 1960 Census shift from ascribed to self-\\nidentification, classification is largely contingent on the particular\\nappraisal of race used. When we say \"race\", we may be discussing\\nself-identification, but we also may be referring to phenotypical\\nfeatures or observed assessments from third parties. Racial classifi-\\ncations are uneasily balanced not only on the particular unstable\\nequilibrium of racial projects, but also on the micro-level processes\\nof race appraisals themselves. When it comes to measurement and\\noperationalization, \"race\" is not a single variable, but many differ-\\ning and sometimes competing variables. Roth [95] refers to this\\nconstellation of variables as the \"multiple dimensions\" of race. Race\\nmanifests in many ways in the real world. Each of these different\\ndimensions can be measured in a different manner for empirical\\n', '505\\n'], ['FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\n', 'Hanna et al.\\n', 'research, and each of these different dimensions have distinct down-\\nstream outcomes. It may therefore be more appropriate to study a\\nparticular outcome using measurement which reflects a respective\\ndimension of race. Table 1 reproduces, with minor amendments,\\nthe table from [95] which outlines each of these dimensions.\\n', 'Racial identity and racial self-classification refer to subjective\\nself-identification of race. In theory, self-identification is one di-\\nmension but in practice these two are measured in different ways\\nand have differing downstream outcomes. Racial identity can be\\nthought of as the sense of self, the identity and broad group with\\nwhich someone belongs. Accordingly, its measurement instrument\\nis that of an open-ended interviewer or survey question. Racial\\nself-classification refers to the discrete categories that one marks\\non intake forms, census surveys, and self-identification documents\\nfor employment. This dimension, as noted earlier, is highly con-\\nstrained by the categories determined a priori by institutional and\\norganizational directives, such as OMB Directive No. 15.\\n', 'Observed race refers to the race which others believe ascribed\\nto an individual. This may be based upon first impression by an\\ninterviewer or annotator. The third-party can make an assessment\\nbased solely on appearance or interaction. Appearance-based ob-\\nserved race depends on readily observable characteristics, whereas\\ninteraction-based observed race depends on language, accent, and\\nother physical, aural, or social cues. Reflected race is the race which\\nan individual believes that others ascribe to them. Although this\\nis a first-person evaluation, it is the first-person evaluation of a\\nthird-party appraisal.\\n', 'Phenotype refers to the set of objective characteristics which\\ncharacterize appearance. A significant literature revolves around\\nskin color appraisals as a means for determining particular social\\noutcomes (e.g. [82, 114]) and the use of skin color as a means of eval-\\nuating facial recognition systems (e.g. [22, 92]). Other race-related\\nphenotypical features include hair texture and color, eye shape and\\ncolor, and lip shape. The related outcomes for phenotypical features\\nare the same as those for observed race, but are not constrained in\\nmeasurement by discrete racial categorization3.\\n', 'The dimensions of race noted here are, of course, unstable across\\ntime, place, and context. Just as racial classifications themselves\\nare tied to particular racial projects, modes of self-identification,\\nobserved race, and reflected race will be tied to the dynamics of\\nthat project. Self-identification has been shown to be responsive to\\none’s arrest records [89] and to one’s class position [115]. Observed\\nrace depends on the interviewer or annotator who is doing the\\nobserving. Reflected race depends not only on phenotype but also\\non the social status of the group in which the individual believes\\nthey are being recognized as. These positions shift across time,\\nnot only across the life course but also across the longue durée of\\ndifferent racial projects.\\n', 'Three major implications follow from the of multiple dimensions\\nparadigm. The first is that there may be inconsistencies across dif-\\nferent dimensions of race. A single individual can have differing\\nracial appraisals. In the health field, for instance, Roth cites several\\nstudies in which individual self-identification differs from medical\\nrecords, interviewer classifications, or death certificates. Second,\\n', '3In a sense, the \"observed race/appearance-based\" dimension and the phenotype\\ndimension are collapsed for computer vision systems, because a computer vision\\nsystem can only \"see\" the objective and phenotypical.\\n', '506\\n', 'the dimensions can cross the boundaries between each other. Phe-\\nnotype and reflected race can impact self-identification but do not\\nfully determine it. However, the third and most important implica-\\ntion, also highlighted in Table 1, is that different dimensions will\\nbe associated with differing outcomes. Therefore, using a measure-\\nment of race which does not reflect social processes associated\\nwith it may misrepresent the scope of racial disparities at best and\\nunderreport them at worst.\\n', '4 LESSONS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nThe variance in what the concept of race can mean has been noted\\nas \"antithetical to the tenets of scientific research, which, in its\\nideal form, demands that analytical variables be consistent and\\ntheir categories mutually exclusive\" [70]. Yet, the social centrality\\nof race positions it as a critical concept in many fields of study. In\\nthis section, we review how other disciplines, such as public health\\nresearch, biomedical research, and studies of social inequality, have\\ngrappled with the use of racial categories within their disciplines.\\nWe surface these discussions to understand how algorithmic fair-\\nness research can learn from these methodological approaches.\\n', '4.1 Limitations in operationalizing race\\nScholars from a range of disciplines have observed a widespread\\nlack of clarity around the use of racial variables within their respec-\\ntive fields. Race is often inconsistently conceptualized and measured\\nacross studies; definitions and processes of operationalization tend\\nto be insufficiently documented. These inconsistencies pose serious\\nchallenges for the validity and utility of research results. For exam-\\nple, inconsistent categories and classification schemes can result\\nin mismatches between different measures of race for the same\\nindividual across different time points or across studies. This in\\nturn can significantly impact health statistics [62, 101], population\\nstatistics [8, 74], and measures of social inequality [102]. Country-\\nspecific understandings of what \"race\" references and local racial\\ncategorization schemes pose significant challenges for international\\ncomparisons [96].\\n', 'Standardizing racial taxonomies and measurement practices does\\nnot sufficiently mitigate the many concerns scholars have raised\\nregarding the use of racial categories in scientific studies. In fact, the\\nwidespread uncritical adoption of racial categories, standardized\\nor not, can erode awareness of the social and political histories of\\nracial taxonomies and reify racial categories as natural kinds [19, 30,\\n42, 43, 78, 100, 111]. The reification of race as a natural category can\\nin turn re-entrench systems of racial stratification which give rise to\\nreal health and social inequalities between different groups [62, 110].\\nThe unquestioning use of racial categories in scientific research\\ncan also lead to misplaced conclusions. For example, the use of race\\nas a natural category can obfuscate the environmental, social, and\\nstructural factors that contribute to health disparities [29, 110] and\\nlead to the racialization of certain diseases [19, 30, 37]. The genomic\\nera in particular has given rise to new concerns regarding the use of\\nrace in technologies and research. Race-based pharmaceuticals have\\nbeen critiqued for their part in reifying racial categories as markers\\nof biological difference [59, 63].

Objections to the use of race as a causal\\nvariable are often couched in terms of manipulability, embodied\\nby the slogan \"no causation without manipulation\" [54]. These\\narguments often point to the physical impossibility of manipu-\\nlating race, thus precluding its use as a causal variable. Several\\nadditional, more sociologically-grounded objections to the use of\\nrace as a causal variable have emerged within social statistics [55],\\nanti-discrimination legal scholarship [67], and health research [46].\\nThese objections point to the fundamental role race plays in struc-\\nturing life experiences, making it nonsensical to talk about two\\nindividuals being identical, save for race. Stated another way, at-\\ntempts to isolate the treatment effect of race are often based on a\\n\"sociologically incoherent conception of what race references\" [67].\\nSeveral scholars have pointed to the significant social conse-\\nquences that arise when race is misconstrued as a variable that\\ncan produce causal effects [3, 46, 58, 124]. First, without proper\\ncontextualization of results, there is a tendency to misattribute the\\ncausal mechanisms of difference the racial categories themselves\\n', '[3, 46, 124], further reifying race as a natural category.

To begin, the choice to use racial categories at all should\\nbe carefully examined, particularly in biological contexts. Despite\\nwidespread agreement that racial categories do not describe geneti-\\ncally distinct populations [84], genomics researchers have grappled\\nfor over a decade with the utility and harm of using racial categories\\nto frame research studies and communicate scientific results. The\\ncontext of use is key to assessing the appropriate use of racial cate-\\ngories. For example, when adopted as a social or political category,\\nrace has utility in genomics, e.g. to document biological differences\\nthat result from processes of racial stratification. However, when\\ndisconnected from their social and political histories, racial cate-\\ngories have no place in biological research [30, 90, 122]. Genetics,\\nbiomedical researchers, and sociologists of science have emphasized\\nthe importance of distinguishing ancestry from racial taxonomies\\n', '507\\n'], ['FAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\n', 'Hanna et al.\\n', 'within biomedical research [40, 49, 84] and have warned against the\\ndangers of of using racial categories to describe genetic variation\\n[14, 30, 122].\\n', 'As noted above in our discussion of Benthall and Haynes, race\\ncannot and should not be done away with entirely. The key chal-\\nlenge here is to \"denaturalize without dematerializing it\" [78] by rec-\\nognizing race as a multidimensional, relational, and socially situated\\nconstruct. This begins with centering the process of conceptualizing\\nand operationalizing race, critically assessing the choice of cate-\\ngories and measurement schemes, and fully articulating and justify-\\ning these decisions in academic communications [46, 60, 71, 77, 83].\\nIn the context of causal studies, several methodologies have\\nbeen proposed to mitigate the risks of reifying race as an entity\\nthat produces causal effects. For example, some researchers have\\nconsidered studies that manipulate properties associated with race,\\nsuch as names [13] 4. Sen and Wasow’s ’bundle of sticks’ framework\\ntheorizes race as a composite variable that can be disaggregated\\ninto constitutive elements, some of which can be manipulated [109].\\nEpidemiological and public health researchers have increasingly\\nshifted their practices towards the study of social determinants of\\nhealth, and in particular, the multiple ways racism affects health\\noutcomes [41, 61, 71, 117, 119, 120]. This shift from studying effects\\nof race to the effects of racism is a central component of critical\\nrace methodologies emerging within other disciplines. For instance,\\nFord and Hawara propose a methodology for the operationalization\\nof race within health equity studies as a multidimensional, context-\\nspecific variable with a relational component to explicitly capture\\nthe effects of racial stratification on health outcomes [34].\\n', 'Moreover, appropriately contextualized descriptive studies can\\nbe an important tool for identifying and understanding patterns\\nof inequality. When race is utilized as a descriptive category, the\\nchoices about what categories to use and how to assign individuals\\nto categories significantly impacts the results of analysis [18, 102,\\n114, 115]. For example, Howell and Emerson compare the effec-\\ntiveness of five different operationalizations of race in predicting\\ndifferent measures of social inequality. The study found each oper-\\nationalization told a different story, pointing to the importance of\\ncritically evaluating racial categories and measurement schemes,\\nas well as the importance of articulating these decisions in the\\ncommunication of results [56].\\n', 'In recent years, anti-racist efforts have emerged within pub-\\nlic health that more thoroughly integrate critical race theory into\\nmethodologies and discourse [35, 36].

Anti-racist practice also emphasizes\\nthe importance of researchers recognizing their privilege and posi-\\ntionality and the way this might shape their practice.

Further, methodologies built\\nupon this conceptualization of race tend to treat groups as inter-\\nchangeable, obscuring the unique oppressions encountered by each\\ngroup.

Recently, Roth\\nhas called more broadly for a \"sociology of racial appraisals\" in\\nwhich we better theorize how observed race has changed over time,\\nand how these changes influence norms of classification [97].

Similarly, we\\nemphasize that the various choices that go into the operational-\\nization of race for the purposes of fairness-informed analysis or\\ninterventions significantly impact the result.

This consideration can inform how the subgroups them-\\nselves are defined (e.g. shifting conceptually from racial categories\\nto categories defined along phenotypic lines) and the way in which\\nthe dataset and analysis results are communicated with the larger\\nresearch community (e.g. detailing procedures for determining cate-\\ngories and category membership, ensuring a distinction is made be-\\ntween phenotypically-determined categories and high-level racial\\ncategories).

In response, the research field of algorithmic fairness has\\nemerged. This rapidly evolving research area is focused on devel-\\noping tools and techniques with aspirations to make development,\\nuse, and resulting impact of algorithmic systems conform to various\\nsocial and legal notions of fairness. The concept of fairness, in ad-\\ndition to being situational, evolving, and contested from a number\\nof philosophical and legal traditions, can only be understood in\\nreference to the different social groups that constitute the organi-\\nzation of society. Consequently, the vast majority of algorithmic\\nfairness frameworks are specified with reference to these social\\ngroups, often requiring a formal encoding of the groups into the\\ndataset and/or algorithm.\\nHowever, most social groups relevant to fairness analysis re-\\nflect highly contextual and unstable social constructs. These social\\ngroups are often defined with recourse to legal anti-discrimination\\nconcepts such as \"protected classes,\" which, in the US, refers to race,\\ncolor, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. However, the\\nprocess of drawing boundaries around distinct social groups for\\nfairness research is fraught; the construction of categories has a\\nlong history of political struggle and legal argumentation.\\nNumerous recent works have highlighted the limitations of cur-\\nrent algorithmic fairness frameworks [53, 108]. Several of these\\ncritiques point to the tendency to abstract away critical social and\\nhistorical contexts and minimize the structural conditions that un-\\nderpin problems of algorithmic unfairness. We build on this critical\\nresearch, focusing specifically on the use of race and racial cate-\\ngories within this field. IN this literature, the topic of the instability\\nof racial categories has gone relative unexplored, with the notable\\nexception of Benthall and Haynes [12], which we discuss in detail\\nbelow.\\nRace is a major axis around which algorithmic allocation of\\nresources and representation is bound. It may indeed be the most\\nsignificant axis, given attention by investigative journalists (e.g. [7])\\nand critical race and technology scholars (e.g. [11, 20, 21, 24, 85]).\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nHanna et al.\\nBecause of this, it is imperative that the race-based methodologies\\nand racial categories themselves are interrogated and critically\\nevaluated.\\nIn this paper we develop several lines of critique directed at the\\ntreatment of race within algorithmic fairness methodologies. In\\nshort, we observe that current methodologies fail to adequately\\naccount for the socially constructed nature of race, instead adopting\\na conceptualization of race as a fixed attribute. This manifests in the\\nwidespread use of racial categories as if they represent natural and\\nobjective differences between groups. Treating race as an attribute,\\nrather than a structural, institutional, and relational phenomenon,\\nin turn serves to minimize the structural aspects of algorithmic\\nunfairness.\\nThe process of operationalizing race is fundamentally a project\\nof racial classification and thus must be understood as a political\\nproject, or, more specifically, what Omi and Winant [86] refer to\\nas a racial project. The tools for measuring individual characteris-\\ntics, such as national censuses and other population-level survey\\ninstruments, were and are still often based in the politics of racial\\noppression and domination. While we acknowledge the importance\\nof measuring race for the purposes of understanding patterns of\\ndifferential performance or differentially adverse impact of algo-\\nrithmic systems, in this work, we emphasize that data collection\\nand annotation efforts must be grounded in the social and historical\\ncontexts of racial classification and racial category formation. To\\noversimplify is to do violence, or even more, to re-inscribe violence\\non communities that already experience structural violence.\\nIt is useful to distinguish between two ways in which race comes\\ninto play in algorithmic fairness research: (i) the operationalization\\nof race, i.e. the process of converting the abstract concept of race\\ninto something that is concrete and measurable and (ii) the use of\\nracial variables within algorithmic frameworks. These aspects are\\ntightly interconnected since race must be operationalized before\\nracial variables can be utilized.\\nOur contributions are as follows: we review the use of race in\\nprior fairness work and discuss an intervention in the debate on\\nracial categories. We then survey the history of racial classifica-\\ntion, scientific racism, and racial classification in national censuses.\\nWe introduce the notion of multidimensionality of race, and sub-\\nsequently review how different disciplines have dealt with the\\ntricky problem of operationalizing race, most notably in biomedical,\\nsurvey, and public health research. In light of these discussions,\\nwe address how race has been treated in the group fairness and\\ndisaggregated analysis paradigms. Lastly, we argue that fairness re-\\nsearchers need to take into account the multidimensionality of race,\\ntake seriously the processes of conceptualizing and operationaliz-\\ning race, focus on processes of racism, and consider perspectives of\\nthose most affected by sociotechnical systems.\\n2 THE PROBLEM WITH RACIAL\\nCATEGORIES\\nIn perhaps the best-known debate surrounding algorithmic fair-\\nness, Julia Angwin and her colleagues illustrated the differing rates\\nat which Black defendants had been issued high pre-trial risk as-\\nsessment scores by the COMPAS recidivism prediction algorithm\\ncompared to white defendants [7]. Equivant – then, Northpointe,\\nthe company which developed COMPAS – defended the system\\nby reanalyzing the ProPublica data [28] and ProPublica later re-\\nsponded [6]. The debate has become a cornerstone of algorithmic\\nfairness research; to date, the original story has some 700 citations\\non Google Scholar.\\nThe Propublica analysis of COMPAS, as well as the responses\\nfrom Northpointe and other secondary analyses performed by third-\\nparty researchers, relied on data from the Broward County Sheriff’s\\nOffice which was obtained through a public records request. Race\\nclassifications in this data identified defendants as Black, White,\\nHispanic, Asian, Native American or Other. These categories look\\nfamiliar – they are nearly identical to the way that the US Census\\ndefines race. However, there are the notable absences of the cate-\\ngories \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\", and there is a\\nredefinition of \"Hispanic\" as a race rather than an ethnicity.\\nIn the methodological appendix to the original article [69], Jeff\\nLarson and other ProPublica authors do not delve into how the\\nrace of the defendant is measured. Larson admits that he did not\\nknow how Broward County classified individuals 1. It’s not clear\\nwhy Broward County used the modified Census racial schema,\\nbut, as detailed below, it may have to do with a 1977 directive\\nfrom the federal US Office of Management and Budget. In general,\\napproaches to measuring race for police records are inconsistent\\nacross municipalities. They can rely on self-identification, state\\nrecords, or observation by criminal justice workers. In her work on\\nracial disparities in incarceration in Wisconsin, sociologist Pamela\\nOliver notes that the race of a single individual can change across\\nrecords even within a single jurisdiction 2. Therefore, even in the\\nmost famous debate of the field, we don’t know why the data take\\non a particular racial schema, nor do we have information about\\nhow defendants are racially categorized.\\n2.1 Using race-like categories?\\nWhile an area of major concern for critical race and technology\\nscholarship, the use of racial categories in algorithmic fairness re-\\nsearch (i.e. the research community which has emerged around\\nvenues like FAT* and AIES) has largely gone unquestioned. There\\nare two important exceptions. First, in the original Gender Shades\\npaper which helped establish intersectional testing, Buolamwini\\nand Gebru note the instability of race and ethnicity labels, which\\njustifies their use of skin tone [22]. Second, the critique levied by\\ncomputational social scientist Sebastian Benthall and critical race\\nscholar Bruce D. Haynes [12] describes how little attention has\\nbeen given to the meaning of protected class labels, the political\\norientation of class labels, and the normative assumptions of ma-\\nchine learning design. They focus on the typical referent group\\n– African-Americans in the US – and discuss how \"racial classi-\\nfication is embedded in state institutions, and reinforced in civil\\nsociety in ways that are relevant to the design of machine learning\\nsystems.\" Race is invoked because \"racial classification signifies\\nsocial, economic, and political inequities anchored in state and civic\\ninstitutional practices.\"\\nWe wholly agree with their overall argument, which is that\\nalgorithmic fairness research has been largely silent on the issues\\n1Personal correspondence, Jeff Larson, August 19, 2019.\\n2Personal correspondence, Pamela Oliver, August 19, 2019.\\n502\\nTowards a Critical Race Methodology in Algorithmic Fairness\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nof racial statistics and categories, and that in that silence, has thus\\nreified them. In their criticism of the COMPAS debate, we echo\\ntheir argument:\\nrather than taking racial statistics... at face value, the\\nprocess that generates them and the process through\\nwhich they are interpreted should be analyzed with\\nthe same rigor and skepticism as the recidivism pre-\\ndiction algorithm. Thematically, we argue that racial\\nbias is far more likely to come from human judgments\\nin data generation and interpretation than from an al-\\ngorithmic model, and that this has broad implications\\nfor fairness in machine learning [12, pp. 291].\\nWe diverge from their critique, not necessarily in their problem\\nformation, but in their solution. They offer up a narrow path to\\nfollow which plots a course between the Scylla of \"[m]achines\\nthat ... [reify] racial categories that are inherent unfair\" and the\\nCharybdis of \"systems that allocate resources in ways that are\\nblind to race [which] will reproduce racial inequality in society\"\\n[12, pp. 294]. In their solution, they propose using an unsupervised\\nmachine learning method to create race-like categories which aim to\\naddress \"historical racial segregation with reproducing the political\\nconstruction of racial categories.\" One virtue of this method is that\\nit is attentive to creating a metric which makes sense with respect\\nto a particular social inequality, that is, spatial segregation. This is\\nsomething we agree with in our adoption of a multidimensional\\nperspective below.\\nWe’d like to raise a few complexities in their formulation which\\nmake us hesitant to adopt their solution. First, it would be a grave\\nerror to supplant the existing categories of race with race-like\\ncategories inferred by unsupervised learning methods. Despite the\\nrisk of reifying the socially constructed idea called race, race does\\nexist in the world, as a way of mental sorting, as a discourse which is\\nadopted, as a social thing which has both structural and ideological\\ncomponents. In other words, although race is social constructed,\\nrace still has power. To supplant race with race-like categories for\\nthe purposes of measurement sidesteps the problem.\\nSecond, supplanting race with race-like categories depends highly\\non context, namely how race operates within particular systems\\nof inequality and domination. Benthall and Haynes restrict their\\nanalysis to that of spatial segregation, which is to be sure, an im-\\nportant and active research area and subject of significant policy\\ndiscussion (e.g. [76, 99]). However, that metric may appear illegi-\\nble to analyses pertaining to other racialized institutions, such as\\nthe criminal justice system, education, or employment (although\\none can readily see their connections and interdependencies). The\\nway that race matters or pertains to particular types of structural\\ninequality depends on that context and requires its own modes of\\noperationalization.\\nThird, and relatedly, as Wendy Chun and Ruha Benjamin have\\ndiscussed [11, 24], race operates both with and as technology. At the\\nsame time we focus on the ontological aspects of race (what is race,\\nhow is it constituted and imagined in the world), it is necessary to\\npay attention to what we do with race and measures which may be\\ninterpreted as race. The creation of metrics and indicators which\\nare race-like will still be interpreted as race. As we discuss more\\nbelow, the example of genomics research is indicative. Even as\\ngenomics researchers warn not to interpret genetic ancestry as race\\nor ethnicity [15, 122], this has not prevented people (e.g. customers\\nof direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies) from interpreting\\nthem as such [98].\\nFinally, we’d like to underline the infrastructural criticism embed-\\nded in the act of categorization itself. By infrastructure, we refer to\\nthe way that classifications and standards form the infrastructure of\\nour existing information society [17]. Inverting infrastructures and\\nseeking their fissures allows us to understand how they are used\\nin practice and how politics are embedded in their creation. This\\npoint dovetails with the critiques levied by abolitionist activists,\\nscholars, and technologists [1, 9, 11]. J. Khadijah Abdurahman [1]\\nargues that to study algorithmic fairness is to sidestep the problem\\nbeyond the algorithmic frame, that we, with communities who are\\ndisproportionally affected by redlining, predictive policing, and\\nsurveillance, should not just contest how \"protected classes within\\nalgorithms are generated-but [should] viscerally reject the notion\\nhuman beings should be placed in cages in the first place.\" The task\\nof using racial classifications at all requires us to expand the frame\\nto consider what the larger implications of classifying are. Who is\\ndoing the classifying? For what purpose are they classifying and to\\nwhat end?\\n3 HISTORIES OF RACIAL CATEGORIZATION\\nWe recount histories of racial category construction by administra-\\ntive and scientific bodies as a means of highlighting the decidedly\\nsocial constructivist notion of race. As Hacking [48] has said, social\\nconstructivism is the act of \"making up people.\" Social construction\\ndoes not mean that things in the world are not \"real\" [31], but that\\nthat thing – be it a racial, gender, or class category – was brought\\ninto existence or shaped by historical events, social forces, political\\npower, and/or colonial conquest, all of which could have been very\\ndifferent. When we demonstrate that something is socially con-\\nstructed, it becomes clear that it could be constructed differently,\\nand then we can start to demand changes in it [48, pp. 6-7].\\nRace as a concept is widely acknowledged by the social sciences\\nto be a social construction. In the racial formation framework, Omi\\nand Winant [86] discuss how race is both real and socially con-\\nstructed. The social constructedness of race decenters the concept\\nas a property of individuals determined by phenotypical properties.\\nInstead, social constructivism places race within specific history\\nand context. The constructedness of race in any given point in time\\nis tied to the specific racial project. A racial project is \"simultane-\\nously an interpretation, representation, or explanation of racial\\nidentities and meanings, and an effort to organize and distribute re-\\nsources (economic, political, cultural) along particular racial lines\"\\n[86, pp. 56]. Those racial projects can range in scale and kind, in\\nthe microinteractional to the structural.\\nRace is not something that arrived whole cloth, but needed to be\\nmade up. Race, although socially constructed, of course has very\\nsalient material effects. Accordingly, the most modern understand-\\ning of race argues that it is inauthentic to conceptualize race as a\\nnatural property of individuals. The \"naturalization\" of race and\\nracial categories do not come from nowhere. It has been constructed\\nand been continually reproduced as part of a project of upholding\\n503\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nHanna et al.\\na particular type of racial project – one that is historically and cul-\\nturally bound. Historian Ibram X. Kendi, for instance, thoroughly\\noutlines the history of race and racial projects from 15-century\\nEurope to the present [64]. Projects that \"misrecognize\" race as\\nnatural [27] are driven by the hegemonic nature of racial projects\\n[86]. It would be more accurate to describe race as relational and as\\na property of institutions, organizations, and larger structures [93].\\nRace may be more accurately discussed as having relational quali-\\nties, with dimensions that are symbolic or based on phenotype, but\\nthat are also contingent on specific social and historical contexts.\\n3.1 Classification and the Racial History of\\nSocial Statistics\\nClassification is a process imbued with social, economic, and orga-\\nnizational imperatives [17, 38]. Those who do the categorizing have\\ntheir own institutional and occupational priorities. Categories them-\\nselves become a type of infrastructure: they are the ground upon\\nwhich other structural and ideational elements are built. When they\\nwork, they are invisible, but when they break down, the boundaries\\nand assumptions begin to show. With the development of markets\\nand the rise of technological innovation and actuarial science, classi-\\nfication of individuals has moved from the more general assessment\\nbased on subgroup distinction to individuation based on market\\nimperatives.\\nAlthough in the modern neoliberal era, markets have been an\\nemerging force in categorization and segmentation [39], the en-\\ntity tasked with categorization above all others has been the state.\\nAlmost as soon as humans began living in agriculturally-based\\ncommunities, it became necessary to count the number of people\\nliving under the control of a certain party [107]. Categorization was\\nalso used to streamline counting items of like type – such as trees\\nin a forest, grain, or human beings. Further, since early grain-based\\nagriculture necessitated vast numbers of essentially slave-laborers,\\nrulers needed to know how many slaves there were and moreover,\\nwho counted as a slave. As Scott argues, during the agricultural\\nrevolution there was initially strong resistance to transitioning\\nfrom life as a hunter-gatherer to a more hierarchical, regimented,\\nand predictable existence as a slave harvesting grain and to \"being\\ncounted\" by newly-created states [107].\\nThe modern discipline of statistics grew out of a bureaucratic\\nneed to manage large populations and natural resources [52]. More\\nspecifically and perniciously, the field of social statistics emerged\\nfrom the need to make differentiations between white Europeans\\nand their descendants, and other peoples. Francis Galton was a\\nmajor figure in the development of social statistics; he was also a\\neugenicist and a major proponent of using statistics as a means to\\njustify racial superiority of European-origin peoples [16, 124, 125].\\nAs Galton writes in his Hereditary Genius:\\nThe natural ability of which this book mainly treats,\\nis such as a modern European possesses in a much\\ngreater average share than men of the lower races.\\nThere is nothing either in the history of domestic\\nanimals or in that evolution to make us doubt that\\na race of sane men may be formed, who shall be as\\nmuch superior mentally and morally to the modern\\n504\\nEuropean as the modern European is to the lowest of\\nthe Negro races (quoted in [124]).\\nThe practice of racial classification that emerged in social sta-\\ntistics is closely tied to the project of nation-building, in multiple\\nsenses. In the first case, racial classification was a prerequisite to\\nthe project of European colonization of the Americas. The racial-\\nization of chattel slavery is a modern phenomenon. European colo-\\nnial projects developed alongside Enlightenment ideas of liberal\\ndemocracy. Creating structures of racial stratification necessitated\\nideational components that would legitimate the enslavement of\\nAfricans [125]. Until the early 20th century in the West and the\\nrise of cultural anthropologists such as Franz Boas, there was wide-\\nspread support for eugenics and scientific racism, and the belief\\nthat the state must intervene to protect the physical and mental\\ncharacteristics of the white race. In 1926, 23 of 48 states had laws\\npermitting sterilization [106]. At the height of miscegenation leg-\\nislation (that is, laws against marriages which were \"interracial\"\\nor \"cross-cultural\" in nature), 41 American colonies and states had\\nlaws against the practice [88]. As the project of nation-building\\n(more specifically, colonization of non-European nations) waned in\\nthe 1960s, so did the popularity of eugenics as a scientific practice.\\nHowever, as Syed Mustafa Ali notes, the scientific racism under-\\ngirding colonialism has persisted as \"‘sedimented’ ways of knowing\\nand being – based on systems of categorisation, classification, and\\ntaxonomisation and the ways that these are manifested in practices,\\nartefacts and technologies\" [2]. Technologies of racial classification,\\nsuch as blood quantum for Native Americans, persist and upon lega-\\ncies of settler colonialism. These technologies become enshrined in\\nfolk understandings of racial percentages, such as genetic ancestry\\n[113], or in law, as blood quantum remains a legal requisite to tribal\\nmembership, tribal constitution, and land claims.\\nSecond, since the founding of the Americas, delineating racial\\nboundaries has been part and parcel of the state-building project.\\nAssessing and evaluating racial and ethnic boundaries is a state\\npractice that coincides not only with a cultural understanding of\\nwho belongs to the polity, but has and continually is a prerequisite\\nfor formal citizenship in many countries. In the pre-war United\\nStates, appeals to citizenship for non-native born residents were\\nfundamentally appeals to whiteness. Lopez documents how appeals\\nto whiteness and the boundaries of the category of whiteness flexed\\nand contracted in legal argumentation [73]. The 1790 Naturalization\\nAct restricted citizenship to \"any alien, being a free white person\"\\nwho had been in the United States for at least two years. It wasn’t\\nuntil the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952\\nthat the explicit racialized nature of naturalization was restricted,\\nalthough the Act laid the groundwork for the current restrictive\\nrace-based ratio system which exists today. Maghbouleh demon-\\nstrates how, prior to 1952, Iranians could be used as a \"racial hinge\"\\nto argue both for and against claims to whiteness, and how citi-\\nzenship claims critically depended on who could make this claim\\n[75].\\nThird, national censuses are a critical component of state ma-\\nchinery. State enumeration of populations works to facilitate the\\nadministrative and bureaucratic functions of the modern nation-\\nstate. As Scott points out:\\nTowards a Critical Race Methodology in Algorithmic Fairness\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nState simplifications such as maps, censuses, cadastral\\nlists, and standard units of measurement represent\\ntechniques for grasping a large and complex reality;\\nin order for officials to be able to comprehend aspects\\nof the ensemble, that complex reality must be reduced\\nto schematic categories. The only way to accomplish\\nthis is to reduce an infinite array of detail to a set of\\ncategories that will facilitate summary descriptions,\\ncomparisons, and aggregation. The invention, elabora-\\ntion, and deployment of these abstractions represent,\\nas Charles Tilly [116] has shown, an enormous leap\\nin state capacity – a move from tribute and indirect\\nrule to taxation and direct rule [106, pp. 77].\\nFurthermore, censuses not only quantify members of racial so-\\ncial groups, but also create and constitute the boundaries of these\\nsocial groups themselves. Melissa Nobles outlines how racial classifi-\\ncations are taken for granted by policymakers, but how national\\ncensuses not only enumerate polity members into racial categories,\\nbut also help to reinscribe racial categories themselves, that is,\\n\"[c]ensus-taking is one of the institutional mechanisms by which\\nracial boundaries are set\" [112, pp. xi]. In the US, the national census\\nis the sole basis for which representation is guaranteed in the House\\nof Representatives and the Electoral College. In the antebellum US,\\nthe Three-Fifths Compromise, in which Black slaves were counted\\nas three-fifths of a human for the purposes of appropriation and\\ntaxation, is the most dramatic example of racial classification in\\ncounting populations. Whereas the passage of the 14th Amendment\\nguaranteed all Americans being counted as a whole person regard-\\nless of race, racial categories defined in the Census in the latter part\\nof the 19th Century reflected fractional referents to Black racial lin-\\neage based in the ascendant movement of eugenics and race science\\nmentioned above. Categories of \"octoroon\" and \"quadroon\", along\\nwith \"mulatto\" denoted fractional heredities of the Black population\\n[112].\\nBecause of the allocative nature of census-taking and the bureau-\\ncracies associated with the practice, what goes into the census is\\npolitically contested by mobilizing racial and ethnic groups. The\\npolitical contestation of the census has been laid bare recently with\\nthe attempted introduction of a citizenship question into the US\\nCensus and its potential for its dampening effects on participation\\nby Latinx groups [72]. For instance, after the 1950 Census, in light\\nof the discoveries of dramatic undercounts of non-white popula-\\ntions and with rising pressures from the Civil Rights Movement,\\nthe 1960 Census shifting from interview identification to asking\\nindividuals to self-identify their race. As Snipp rightly points out,\\nthis procedural change was a \"fundamental redefinition of race.\"\\nPopulation statistics formerly based on phenotypical appearances\\nwere now based on \"cultural affiliation and other deeply held per-\\nsonal considerations beyond the pale of conventional demographic\\ninquiry\" [112, pp. 570]. This shift was not only bureaucratic but\\nalso (perhaps unknowingly by the Census Bureau) ontological: race\\nas measured by the Census aligned more with the social construc-\\ntionism and less with essentialism. The Office of Management and\\nBudget (OMB) Directive No. 15 of 1977 instituted a standard in\\nracial classifications used by government agencies and developed a\\nstandard for five distinct groups: (a) American Indians and Alaska\\nNatives, (b) Asian and Pacific Islanders, (c) Non-Hispanic Blacks, (d)\\nNon-Hispanic Whites, and (e) Hispanics. The impact of this direc-\\ntive had far-reaching implications, as this categorization \"permeated\\nevery level of government, many if not most large corporations,\\nand many other institutions such as schools and nonprofit orga-\\nnizations\" ([87], cited in [112]). The 1997 revision of Directive No.\\n15 separated out Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, set\\nHispanics and Latinos apart as an ethnic group (rather than a racial\\ngroup), and allowed respondents to provide multiple responses to\\nracial heritage [112].\\nDramatic changes in governance have large downstream effects\\nfor the accuracy of census counts and their categories. Khalfani et\\nal. document the differences between the South African numbers\\nbefore and after the reign of Mandela’s African National Congress,\\nand find that the raw counts and the estimations from aerial pho-\\ntography both dramatically undercount the majority African popu-\\nlations, as well as women [65]. The US Census Bureau spends a non-\\ntrivial amount of effort getting enumeration correct for marginal-\\nized groups; however, those efforts can be stymied with the winds of\\npartisanship and political administration. Even without the issues\\nraised by a potential citizenship question, decreased or flat-lined\\nfunding has left the Census Bureau understaffed and unable to\\nthoroughly test new methodologies [32].\\nIn sum, the act of classification cannot be divorced from the\\ngroup who is doing the classification and the organizational and\\ninstitutional pressures of performing classification. Racial classifi-\\ncation has a long history within quantitative social science, and,\\nin some ways, is the reason that social statistics have developed\\nthe way they did. That history is grounded in eugenicist thought\\nand practice, and much of that work provided the infrastructure\\nfor census-taking in the US, Canada, Latin America, and South\\nAfrica. More expansive categorization resulted from social and po-\\nlitical movements in those countries. In short, categorization itself\\nis a technological infrastructure within which institutional racism\\ncontinues to reside. In this way, we can realize the ways in which\\nrace intersects with technology but also as a technology in and\\nof itself. The framing of race as technology shifts the terrain of\\nthe discussion – rather, from what race is and how we can classify\\nindividuals, to what we can do with race and how to make it do\\ndifferent (and explicitly anti-racist) things.\\n3.2 The multidimensionality of race\\nAs highlighted by the 1960 Census shift from ascribed to self-\\nidentification, classification is largely contingent on the particular\\nappraisal of race used. When we say \"race\", we may be discussing\\nself-identification, but we also may be referring to phenotypical\\nfeatures or observed assessments from third parties. Racial classifi-\\ncations are uneasily balanced not only on the particular unstable\\nequilibrium of racial projects, but also on the micro-level processes\\nof race appraisals themselves. When it comes to measurement and\\noperationalization, \"race\" is not a single variable, but many differ-\\ning and sometimes competing variables. Roth [95] refers to this\\nconstellation of variables as the \"multiple dimensions\" of race. Race\\nmanifests in many ways in the real world. Each of these different\\ndimensions can be measured in a different manner for empirical\\n505\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nHanna et al.\\nresearch, and each of these different dimensions have distinct down-\\nstream outcomes. It may therefore be more appropriate to study a\\nparticular outcome using measurement which reflects a respective\\ndimension of race. Table 1 reproduces, with minor amendments,\\nthe table from [95] which outlines each of these dimensions.\\nRacial identity and racial self-classification refer to subjective\\nself-identification of race. In theory, self-identification is one di-\\nmension but in practice these two are measured in different ways\\nand have differing downstream outcomes. Racial identity can be\\nthought of as the sense of self, the identity and broad group with\\nwhich someone belongs. Accordingly, its measurement instrument\\nis that of an open-ended interviewer or survey question. Racial\\nself-classification refers to the discrete categories that one marks\\non intake forms, census surveys, and self-identification documents\\nfor employment. This dimension, as noted earlier, is highly con-\\nstrained by the categories determined a priori by institutional and\\norganizational directives, such as OMB Directive No. 15.\\nObserved race refers to the race which others believe ascribed\\nto an individual. This may be based upon first impression by an\\ninterviewer or annotator. The third-party can make an assessment\\nbased solely on appearance or interaction. Appearance-based ob-\\nserved race depends on readily observable characteristics, whereas\\ninteraction-based observed race depends on language, accent, and\\nother physical, aural, or social cues. Reflected race is the race which\\nan individual believes that others ascribe to them. Although this\\nis a first-person evaluation, it is the first-person evaluation of a\\nthird-party appraisal.\\nPhenotype refers to the set of objective characteristics which\\ncharacterize appearance. A significant literature revolves around\\nskin color appraisals as a means for determining particular social\\noutcomes (e.g. [82, 114]) and the use of skin color as a means of eval-\\nuating facial recognition systems (e.g. [22, 92]). Other race-related\\nphenotypical features include hair texture and color, eye shape and\\ncolor, and lip shape. The related outcomes for phenotypical features\\nare the same as those for observed race, but are not constrained in\\nmeasurement by discrete racial categorization3.\\nThe dimensions of race noted here are, of course, unstable across\\ntime, place, and context. Just as racial classifications themselves\\nare tied to particular racial projects, modes of self-identification,\\nobserved race, and reflected race will be tied to the dynamics of\\nthat project. Self-identification has been shown to be responsive to\\none’s arrest records [89] and to one’s class position [115]. Observed\\nrace depends on the interviewer or annotator who is doing the\\nobserving. Reflected race depends not only on phenotype but also\\non the social status of the group in which the individual believes\\nthey are being recognized as. These positions shift across time,\\nnot only across the life course but also across the longue durée of\\ndifferent racial projects.\\nThree major implications follow from the of multiple dimensions\\nparadigm. The first is that there may be inconsistencies across dif-\\nferent dimensions of race. A single individual can have differing\\nracial appraisals. In the health field, for instance, Roth cites several\\nstudies in which individual self-identification differs from medical\\nrecords, interviewer classifications, or death certificates. Second,\\n3In a sense, the \"observed race/appearance-based\" dimension and the phenotype\\ndimension are collapsed for computer vision systems, because a computer vision\\nsystem can only \"see\" the objective and phenotypical.\\n506\\nthe dimensions can cross the boundaries between each other. Phe-\\nnotype and reflected race can impact self-identification but do not\\nfully determine it. However, the third and most important implica-\\ntion, also highlighted in Table 1, is that different dimensions will\\nbe associated with differing outcomes. Therefore, using a measure-\\nment of race which does not reflect social processes associated\\nwith it may misrepresent the scope of racial disparities at best and\\nunderreport them at worst.\\n4 LESSONS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nThe variance in what the concept of race can mean has been noted\\nas \"antithetical to the tenets of scientific research, which, in its\\nideal form, demands that analytical variables be consistent and\\ntheir categories mutually exclusive\" [70]. Yet, the social centrality\\nof race positions it as a critical concept in many fields of study. In\\nthis section, we review how other disciplines, such as public health\\nresearch, biomedical research, and studies of social inequality, have\\ngrappled with the use of racial categories within their disciplines.\\nWe surface these discussions to understand how algorithmic fair-\\nness research can learn from these methodological approaches.\\n4.1 Limitations in operationalizing race\\nScholars from a range of disciplines have observed a widespread\\nlack of clarity around the use of racial variables within their respec-\\ntive fields. Race is often inconsistently conceptualized and measured\\nacross studies; definitions and processes of operationalization tend\\nto be insufficiently documented. These inconsistencies pose serious\\nchallenges for the validity and utility of research results. For exam-\\nple, inconsistent categories and classification schemes can result\\nin mismatches between different measures of race for the same\\nindividual across different time points or across studies. This in\\nturn can significantly impact health statistics [62, 101], population\\nstatistics [8, 74], and measures of social inequality [102]. Country-\\nspecific understandings of what \"race\" references and local racial\\ncategorization schemes pose significant challenges for international\\ncomparisons [96].\\nStandardizing racial taxonomies and measurement practices does\\nnot sufficiently mitigate the many concerns scholars have raised\\nregarding the use of racial categories in scientific studies. In fact, the\\nwidespread uncritical adoption of racial categories, standardized\\nor not, can erode awareness of the social and political histories of\\nracial taxonomies and reify racial categories as natural kinds [19, 30,\\n42, 43, 78, 100, 111]. The reification of race as a natural category can\\nin turn re-entrench systems of racial stratification which give rise to\\nreal health and social inequalities between different groups [62, 110].\\nThe unquestioning use of racial categories in scientific research\\ncan also lead to misplaced conclusions. For example, the use of race\\nas a natural category can obfuscate the environmental, social, and\\nstructural factors that contribute to health disparities [29, 110] and\\nlead to the racialization of certain diseases [19, 30, 37]. The genomic\\nera in particular has given rise to new concerns regarding the use of\\nrace in technologies and research. Race-based pharmaceuticals have\\nbeen critiqued for their part in reifying racial categories as markers\\nof biological difference [59, 63]. Genetic ancestry testing has been\\ncriticized for its potential to promote biological essentialilsm and\\nreinforce race privilege amongst those already experiencing it [15,\\nTowards a Critical Race Methodology in Algorithmic Fairness\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nDimension\\nDescription\\nTypical Measurement\\nRacial identity\\nSubjective self-identification, not\\nlimited by pre-set options.\\nOpen-ended\\nquestion\\nself-identification\\nRacial Self-Classification The race you check on an official\\nform or survey with constrained\\noptions (e.g. the Census)\\nThe race others believe you to be\\nObserved Race\\nClosed-ended survey question\\nInterviewer classification\\n- Appearance-Based\\nObserved race based on readily ob-\\nservable characteristics\\n- Interaction-Based\\nReflected Race\\nPhenotype\\nObserved race based on character-\\nistics revealed through interaction\\n(e.g. language, accent, surname)\\nThe race you believe others as-\\nsume you to be\\nRacial appearance\\nInterviewer classification with in-\\nstructions to classify on first obser-\\nvation\\nInterview classification with in-\\nstructions to classify after interac-\\ntion or survey\\nA question such as \"What race do\\nmost people think you are?\"\\nUsually interviewer classification,\\nbut also \"objective\" characteristics\\nsuch as: skin color; hair texture and\\ncolor; nose shape; lip shape; eye\\ncolor\\nOutcomes it may be appropriate for\\nstudying\\nPolitical mobilization; assimilation;\\nsocial networks; voting; residential\\ndecision-making; attitudes\\nDemographic change; vital statis-\\ntics; disease and illness rates\\nDiscrimination; socioeconomic dis-\\npartiies; residential segregation;\\ncriminal justice indicators; health\\ncare/service provision\\nRacial profiling; discrimination in\\npublic settings\\nWorkplace discrimination; housing\\ndiscrimination;\\nlanguage/accent-\\nbased discrimination\\nSelf-identification processes; per-\\nceived discrimination\\nDiscrimination; socioeconomic dis-\\npartiies; residential segregation;\\ncriminal justice indicators; health\\ncare/service provision\\nTable 1: Multiple dimensions of race. Reproduced and amended from [95]. Note that we have excluded \"racial ancestry\" from\\nthis table. Genetics, biomedical researchers, and sociologists of science have criticized the use of \"race\" to describe genetic\\nancestry within biomedical research [40, 49, 84, 122], while others have criticized the use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing\\nand its implications for racial and ethnic identification [15, 91, 113].\\n98]. Finally, bioinformatics tools and research practices themselves\\ncontribute to the essentialization of race [10, 42, 43, 51].\\nThere has also been significant debate about the appropriate\\nuse of racial variables in studies aimed at identifying causal ef-\\nfects [46, 54, 55, 58, 67]. Objections to the use of race as a causal\\nvariable are often couched in terms of manipulability, embodied\\nby the slogan \"no causation without manipulation\" [54]. These\\narguments often point to the physical impossibility of manipu-\\nlating race, thus precluding its use as a causal variable. Several\\nadditional, more sociologically-grounded objections to the use of\\nrace as a causal variable have emerged within social statistics [55],\\nanti-discrimination legal scholarship [67], and health research [46].\\nThese objections point to the fundamental role race plays in struc-\\nturing life experiences, making it nonsensical to talk about two\\nindividuals being identical, save for race. Stated another way, at-\\ntempts to isolate the treatment effect of race are often based on a\\n\"sociologically incoherent conception of what race references\" [67].\\nSeveral scholars have pointed to the significant social conse-\\nquences that arise when race is misconstrued as a variable that\\ncan produce causal effects [3, 46, 58, 124]. First, without proper\\ncontextualization of results, there is a tendency to misattribute the\\ncausal mechanisms of difference the racial categories themselves\\n[3, 46, 124], further reifying race as a natural category. Second,\\nmisidentifying race, rather than racial stratification, as the root\\ncause of social and health disparities can lead to misplaced conclu-\\nsions and ineffective public policy interventions [46].\\n4.2 Critical race methodologies\\nThese critiques have given rise to a host of critical race methodolo-\\ngies informing the use of racial categories within these respective\\ndisciplines. To begin, the choice to use racial categories at all should\\nbe carefully examined, particularly in biological contexts. Despite\\nwidespread agreement that racial categories do not describe geneti-\\ncally distinct populations [84], genomics researchers have grappled\\nfor over a decade with the utility and harm of using racial categories\\nto frame research studies and communicate scientific results. The\\ncontext of use is key to assessing the appropriate use of racial cate-\\ngories. For example, when adopted as a social or political category,\\nrace has utility in genomics, e.g. to document biological differences\\nthat result from processes of racial stratification. However, when\\ndisconnected from their social and political histories, racial cate-\\ngories have no place in biological research [30, 90, 122]. Genetics,\\nbiomedical researchers, and sociologists of science have emphasized\\nthe importance of distinguishing ancestry from racial taxonomies\\n507\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nHanna et al.\\nwithin biomedical research [40, 49, 84] and have warned against the\\ndangers of of using racial categories to describe genetic variation\\n[14, 30, 122].\\nAs noted above in our discussion of Benthall and Haynes, race\\ncannot and should not be done away with entirely. The key chal-\\nlenge here is to \"denaturalize without dematerializing it\" [78] by rec-\\nognizing race as a multidimensional, relational, and socially situated\\nconstruct. This begins with centering the process of conceptualizing\\nand operationalizing race, critically assessing the choice of cate-\\ngories and measurement schemes, and fully articulating and justify-\\ning these decisions in academic communications [46, 60, 71, 77, 83].\\nIn the context of causal studies, several methodologies have\\nbeen proposed to mitigate the risks of reifying race as an entity\\nthat produces causal effects. For example, some researchers have\\nconsidered studies that manipulate properties associated with race,\\nsuch as names [13] 4. Sen and Wasow’s ’bundle of sticks’ framework\\ntheorizes race as a composite variable that can be disaggregated\\ninto constitutive elements, some of which can be manipulated [109].\\nEpidemiological and public health researchers have increasingly\\nshifted their practices towards the study of social determinants of\\nhealth, and in particular, the multiple ways racism affects health\\noutcomes [41, 61, 71, 117, 119, 120]. This shift from studying effects\\nof race to the effects of racism is a central component of critical\\nrace methodologies emerging within other disciplines. For instance,\\nFord and Hawara propose a methodology for the operationalization\\nof race within health equity studies as a multidimensional, context-\\nspecific variable with a relational component to explicitly capture\\nthe effects of racial stratification on health outcomes [34].\\nMoreover, appropriately contextualized descriptive studies can\\nbe an important tool for identifying and understanding patterns\\nof inequality. When race is utilized as a descriptive category, the\\nchoices about what categories to use and how to assign individuals\\nto categories significantly impacts the results of analysis [18, 102,\\n114, 115]. For example, Howell and Emerson compare the effec-\\ntiveness of five different operationalizations of race in predicting\\ndifferent measures of social inequality. The study found each oper-\\nationalization told a different story, pointing to the importance of\\ncritically evaluating racial categories and measurement schemes,\\nas well as the importance of articulating these decisions in the\\ncommunication of results [56].\\nIn recent years, anti-racist efforts have emerged within pub-\\nlic health that more thoroughly integrate critical race theory into\\nmethodologies and discourse [35, 36]. While earlier studies of the\\nsocial determinants of health tend to center individual and interper-\\nsonal racialized experiences, this new paradigm shifts focus to the\\ninstitutional and structural conditions that shape racial disparities\\nin health [44, 45, 110, 118]. Anti-racist practice also emphasizes\\nthe importance of researchers recognizing their privilege and posi-\\ntionality and the way this might shape their practice. For example,\\nthe Public Health Critical Race Praxis offers a self-reflexive and\\nrace-conscious research methodology that centers discourse and\\npractice around the perspectives of socially marginalized groups,\\nbuilding on community-based participatory approaches [35].\\n4However, Kohler-Hausmann has been critical of such \"audit\" studies for not being\\nable to isolate the treatment effect for race, although they do, in some circumstances,\\n\"provide evidence of a constitutive claim that grounds a thick ethical evaluation\" [67,\\npp. 33-34]\\n508\\n5 IMPLICATIONS FOR USING RACE IN\\nALGORITHMIC FAIRNESS RESEARCH\\nWe observe several widespread tendencies when using race within\\nalgorithmic fairness research. First, frameworks for describing and\\nmitigating unfairness adopt a simplistic conceptualization of race\\nas a single dimensional variable that can take on a handful of val-\\nues. This simplification erases the social, economic, and political\\ncomplexity of the racial categories. Further, methodologies built\\nupon this conceptualization of race tend to treat groups as inter-\\nchangeable, obscuring the unique oppressions encountered by each\\ngroup. We argue that this framing limits the effectiveness of fair-\\nness analysis and interventions and risks reifying racial categories\\nin the process.\\nSecond, the process of conceptualizing and operationalizing race\\nfor the purposes of studying or mitigating different aspects of algo-\\nrithmic fairness has – with the exceptions noted above – received\\nlittle attention. Moreover, racial categories are frequently adopted\\nwith little attention given to the histories of the categories or suit-\\nability of the categories for the fairness assessment.\\nWe discuss the importance of focusing on categories and mea-\\nsurement processes, and fully articulating these decisions in com-\\nmunication of results. Lastly, we discuss the use of disaggregated\\nanalysis and the implications for incorporating a more nuanced\\nunderstanding of measurement for these analyses.\\n5.1 Race and group fairness\\nGroup fairness criteria represent a class of algorithmic fairness\\ndefinitions predicated on clearly defined subgroups in the dataset.\\n\"Fairness\" is obtained by equalizing a particular statistic, or set\\nof statistics, of the classifier across groups. Many different group\\nfairness criteria have been proposed. For example, demographic\\nparity requires equal rates of positive prediction [33] across groups.\\nEquality of odds [50], also referred to as equalized mistreatment\\n[123], requires equal false positive and false negative rates across\\ngroups. Equal opportunity [50] restricts this requirement to only\\na single value of the true outcome. Calibration (or test fairness)\\n[23, 66] requires the actual outcome to be independent of protected\\nattributes, conditioned on estimated outcome.\\nWhile limitations of group fairness criteria have been previously\\nexplored [26, 47], here we focus our examination on the conceptu-\\nalization of race embedded within this framework. By abstracting\\nracial categories into a mathematically comparable form, group-\\nbased fairness criteria deny the hierarchical nature and the social,\\neconomic, and political complexity of the social groups under con-\\nsideration. Most notably, critical race theorists and Black feminist\\nthinkers have criticized group fairness approaches for their under-\\nlying ideal, liberal approaches to ameliorating past harms.\\nBlack feminist cultural geographer Katherine McKittrick, fol-\\nlowing Patricia Hill Collins, discusses how such approaches have\\nresulted in a ’flattened geography’ which obscures the unique op-\\npressions encountered by Black women, instead treating oppressed\\nsocial groups as interchangeable [25, 79]. Ladson-Billings and Tate,\\nin their critical race critique of liberal education paradigms, explain\\nthat the tension between and even among different racial groups are\\nnot adequately examined or understood and assume \"that all differ-\\nence is both analogous and equivalent\" [68]. Political philosopher\\nTowards a Critical Race Methodology in Algorithmic Fairness\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nCharles W. Mills notes that the liberal underpinnings of both theo-\\nretical and methodological approaches towards equalization have\\nhistorically tended to have significant detrimental consequences\\nfor racial minorities and only serves to advance a white \"racial\\ncontract\" [80].\\nIn short, group fairness approaches try to achieve sameness\\nacross groups without regard for the difference between the groups.\\nGroup fairness offers an incomplete version of what a race-conscious\\npolicy would be. This treats everyone the same from an algo-\\nrithmic perspective without acknowledging that people are not\\ntreated the same. As political philosopher Elizabeth Anderson notes,\\n\"[s]tandard conceptions of distributive equality, embodied in ideas\\nof equality of opportunity... fail to consider how such opportunities\\nbuild in group hierarchy\" [4].\\n5.2 Conceptualizing and operationalizing race\\nThe question of how best to operationalize race for the purposes\\nof studying or mitigating different aspects of algorithmic unfair-\\nness has received little attention. By discounting the considerations\\nthat go into operationalizing race, the scope and effectiveness of\\nsubsequent analysis and interventions fail to interrogate how the\\nparticular operationalization and measurement affect a given out-\\ncome. For instance, referring to Table 1, while observed race may\\nbe more important for studying discrimination, self-identification\\nmay be more suitable for studying identity formation and voting\\nbehavior.\\nWe suggest centering the process of conceptualizing and opera-\\ntionalizing race when working with racial variables. In particular,\\nwe urge algorithmic fairness researchers to critically evaluate exist-\\ning racial schemas. Because of data limitations, we are most often\\nbound to the categories provided by census categories or other\\ntaxonomies which stem from bureaucratic processes. We know\\nfrom the histories outlined above that these categories are unstable,\\ncontingent, and rooted in racial inequality.\\nFollowing recent work around measurement and fairness [5, 57],\\nwe suggest taking seriously the problems of measurement modeling\\nwhen considering racial variables. Race, like fairness, is itself a\\ncontested concept, and it follows that adopting a multidimensional\\nview is one strategy forward for approaching this. Recently, Roth\\nhas called more broadly for a \"sociology of racial appraisals\" in\\nwhich we better theorize how observed race has changed over time,\\nand how these changes influence norms of classification [97]. Given\\nthat most, if not all, of algorithmic fairness research is ostensibly\\nconcerned with anti-discrimination, this charge should be taken\\nseriously.\\nAs a helpful analogue, a growing body of survey research has\\nhighlighted the impact that racial category and measurement choices\\ncan have on outcomes being measured [102–104]. Similarly, we\\nemphasize that the various choices that go into the operational-\\nization of race for the purposes of fairness-informed analysis or\\ninterventions significantly impact the result. Therefore, we need\\nto be transparent about definitions, categories, measurements, and\\nmotivations for racial schema used in research and publication. If\\npossible, multiple measures of race should be collected. In addition,\\nmeasurement of race should be considered as an empirical problem\\nin its own right.\\nIn domains where the categorization is based solely on observ-\\nable characteristics, e.g. image datasets are annotated by third-\\nparties, care needs to be taken to ensure race is not reduced to\\nphenotype. This consideration can inform how the subgroups them-\\nselves are defined (e.g. shifting conceptually from racial categories\\nto categories defined along phenotypic lines) and the way in which\\nthe dataset and analysis results are communicated with the larger\\nresearch community (e.g. detailing procedures for determining cate-\\ngories and category membership, ensuring a distinction is made be-\\ntween phenotypically-determined categories and high-level racial\\ncategories). In the context of disaggregated evaluations in computer\\nvision domains, the FAT* community has already seen a marked\\nshift towards defining groups based on phenotypic properties rather\\nthan racial categories, thanks to the pioneering work of Buolamwini\\nand colleagues.\\nHowever, we also note that shifting to phenotypically-determined\\ncategories does not provide a full-stop solution. Given the dark his-\\ntory of physiognomy and phrenology [121], in particular their role\\nin promoting scientific racism and eugenics, researchers should\\nbe careful when imposing categories based on, for example, facial\\nlandmarks (e.g. IBM’s diversity in faces dataset has labelled facial\\ndimensions, proportions, etc.). Doing so risks devolving into using\\nphenotypical features as inputs for a predictive models for individ-\\nual characteristics and internal psychological states. Furthermore,\\nwhile phenotype can be used as a means to understand processes of\\ndiscrimination, practitioners should not equate race to phenotype,\\nnot to mention other biological markers such as genomes.\\n5.3 Disaggregated analysis\\nFrameworks for algorithmic audit studies [22, 92] and standardized\\nmodel reporting guidelines [81] have highlighted the importance\\nof reporting model statistics disaggregated by groups defined along\\ncultural, demographic, or phenotypic lines. In contrast to group\\nfairness definitions, which are often employed as ideals to be met,\\ndisaggregated analysis operates at a descriptive level. These analy-\\nses should begin from a pragmatist understanding of differences\\nand interrogate the most salient aspects of race to be considered for\\nparticular technologies. For instance, in their audits of facial anal-\\nysis technologies, Buolamwini and her colleagues concentrate on\\nthe phenotypical dimensions of race to understand the disparities\\nof these vision-based systems5. Results of disaggregated analysis\\ndepend heavily on the choice of categories and racial measurements\\nused.\\nWithin survey research, sociologists of race have investigated\\nthe utility of different racial categories for the purposes of under-\\nstanding markers of social inequality. Howell and Emerson find that\\na five-fold measure of self-identified race explains more variation\\nin measures of inequality in income, housing, and health in the US\\n[56]. Saperstein and Penner find that racial categorization operates\\nboth as an input and an output to racial inequality. Individuals who\\nexperience an increase in social position (e.g. increased income)\\nmay be more likely to \"lighten\" themselves in survey responses,\\nwhile those who become more disadvantaged (e.g. experiencing\\nunemployment or incarceration) may \"darken\" themselves [89, 105].\\nThe implication here is that it is necessary to understand the way\\n5It should be noted that they do not take a similar approach towards gender.\\n509\\nFAT* ’20, January 27–30, 2020, Barcelona, Spain\\nHanna et al.\\nthat a particular racial dimension manifests in measurement and\\nhow it relates to the sociotechnical system under consideration. We\\nencourage algorithmic fairness researchers to explore how different\\nracial dimensions and their attendant measurements might reveal\\ndifferent patterns of unfairness in sociotechnical systems.\\n5.4 Limits of the algorithmic frame\\nBefore undertaking the project of systematizing social groups based\\non race, we should begin by interrogating why race is a relevant\\nfactor in the analysis of the system to begin with. Here, it is criti-\\ncal to expand the scope of analysis beyond the algorithmic frame\\n[108] and interrogate how patterns of racial oppression might be\\nembedded in the data and model and might interact with the re-\\nsulting system. We urge researchers to question the following: is\\ndelineating data along racial lines critical to understanding patterns\\nof fairness produced or reproduced by the system?\\nIn many cases, severe fairness concerns are evident prior to\\nany quantitative race-based analysis of the system’s outputs. For\\nexample, Rashida Richardson and colleagues recently published\\nan extensive survey of the \"dirty data\" used to develop predictive\\npolicing systems in the US [94]. The report reveals that in nine out\\nof the thirteen jurisdictions reviewed, predictive policing systems\\ningested data that was generated while the jurisdiction was un-\\nder investigation for corrupt, racially-biased, or otherwise illegal\\npolicing practices. This work represents an analysis centered not\\naround race but around racially disparate policing patterns. This\\nechoes much of the work from within health and biomedical sci-\\nences which emphasizes a racism effect rather than a race effect.\\n5.5 Centering perspectives of marginalized\\ngroups\\nLastly, interventions in the vein of algorithmic fairness need to con-\\nsider the problems of the racially oppressed based on their view of\\ninjustices. Political philosopher Elizabeth Anderson proposes that\\nwe think about injustices from what she calls a non-ideal standpoint\\nmethodology [4]. The methodology is non-ideal insofar as that it\\nviews injustices from the point of view of the aggrieved groups and\\nthe particular harms these groups are facing. The methodology is\\n\"standpoint\"-based insofar as we should begin from the perspec-\\ntives of oppressed groups. Here, we can draw lessons from public\\nhealth scholars who prioritize community-based participatory ap-\\nproaches. These methodologies, which are grounded in critical race\\ntheory and feminist standpoint epistemology, take lived experi-\\nences of marginalized groups as a valuable and essential source of\\nknowledge.\\n6 CONCLUSION\\nIn this article, we have pulled back the frame from the algorithms\\ninvolved in algorithmic fairness themselves and focused on the cat-\\negories which constitute the \"protected classes\" used within these\\nframeworks. We focus on race, given the critical nexus of race,\\ntechnology, and inequality, and the prevalence of race in algorith-\\nmic fairness scholarship. We traced the histories of classification,\\neugenics, and state-sponsored category creation, and warned of the\\ntendency to reify and naturalize racial categories which were the\\n510\\nproduct of long histories of inequality. We then noted the multidi-\\nmensionality of race and considered lessons from disciplines which\\nhave been dealing with this issue for decades. Lastly, we review\\nthe algorithmic fairness literature in light of these considerations.\\nWe highlight limitations of algorithmic fairness methodologies that\\nadopt a simplistic and de-contextualized understanding of race and\\noutline several suggestions for algorithmic fairness researchers\\nmoving forward.\\nMost in the FAT* community are what Ruha Benjamin calls\\nthe \"overserved\" [11]. In this light, racial classifications need to\\nbe interrogated from the perspective of who they serve. Who is\\ndoing the categorizing and for what purpose? As in the beginning\\nof this article, we echo J. Khadijah Abdurahman, \"it is not just\\nthat classification systems are inaccurate or biased, it is who has\\nthe power to classify, to determine the repercussions / policies\\nassociated thereof and their relation to historical and accumulated\\ninjustice.\" Racial classifications can be an important tool in post-\\nhoc disaggregation analysis. However, we need to know how to\\ndisaggregate, how to contextualize categories of disaggregation,\\nand who that categorization serves.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThanks to Anna Lauren Hoffmann, Ben Hutchinson, Emma Kaywin,\\nIssa Kohler-Haussman, Joan Fujimura, Lauren Mangels, Simone Wu,\\nand the three anonymous FAT* reviewers for helpful comments.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] J.
