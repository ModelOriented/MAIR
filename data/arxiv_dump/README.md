## FILES

### `affiliations_annotated.json`
This is a file with affiliations metadata for an arxiv dump (less than 600 articles).
When `manually_annotated` is true it was filled manually.
Mail domains have a reasonable coverage but lots of them are missing.
DBpedia ids work good with mapping different names of one thing (also some abbreviations).
However, small companies and research labs are missing. There's also some noise.
The order if names, dbpedia ids and types is fixed (they correspond to each other). It is not true for mail domains.
