  "abstractText": "This paper considers extractive summarisation in a comparative setting: given two or more document groups (e.g., separated by publication time), the goal is to select a small number of documents that are representative of each group, and also maximally distinguishable from other groups. We formulate a set of new objective functions for this problem that connect recent literature on document summarisation, interpretable machine learning, and data subset selection. In particular, by casting the problem as a binary classification amongst different groups, we derive objectives based on the notion of maximum mean discrepancy, as well as a simple yet effective gradient-based optimisation strategy. Our new formulation allows scalable evaluations of comparative summarisation as a classification task, both automatically and via crowd-sourcing. To this end, we evaluate comparative summarisation methods on a newly curated collection of controversial news topics over 13months.We observe that gradient-based optimisation outperforms discrete and baseline approaches in 14 out of 24 different automatic evaluation settings. In crowd-sourced evaluations, summaries from gradient optimisation elicit 7% more accurate classification from human workers than discrete optimisation. Our result contrasts with recent literature on submodular data subset selection that favours discrete optimisation. We posit that our formulation of comparative summarisation will prove useful in a diverse range of use cases such as comparing content sources, authors, related topics, or distinct view points.",

      "text": "Extractive summarisation is the task of selecting a few representative documents from a larger collection. In this paper, we consider comparative summarisation: given groups of document collections, the aim is to select documents that represent each group, but also highlight differences between groups. This is in contrast to traditional document summaries which aim to represent each group by independently optimising for coverage and diversity, without considering other groups. As a concrete example, given thousands of news articles per month on a certain topic, groups can be formed by publication time, by source, or by political leaning. Comparative summarisation systems can then help answer user questions such as: what is new on the topic of climate change this week, what is different between the coverage in NYTimes and BBC, or\n\u2217Now at Google Research.\nwhat are the key articles covering the carbon tax and the Paris agreement? In this work, we focus on highlighting changes within a long running news topic over time; see Figure 1 for an illustration. Existing methods for extractive summarisation use a variety of formulations such as structured prediction (Li et al. 2009), optimisation of submodular functions (Lin and Bilmes 2011), dataset interpretability (Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016), and dataset selection via submodular optimisation (Mirzasoleiman, Badanidiyuru, and Karbasi 2016; Wei, Iyer, and Bilmes 2015; Mitrovic et al. 2018). Moreover, recent formulations of comparative summarisation use discriminative sentence selection (Wang et al. 2012; Li, Li, and Li 2012), or highlight differences in common concepts across documents (Huang, Wan, and Xiao 2011). But the connections and distinctions of these approaches has yet to be clearly articulated. To evaluate summaries, traditional approaches employ automatic metrics such as ROUGE (Lin 2004) on manually constructed summaries (Lin and Hovy 2003; Nenkova, Passonneau, and McKeown 2007). This is difficult to employ for new tasks and new datasets, and does not scale.\nOur approach to comparative summarisation is based on a novel formulation of the problem in terms of two competing classification tasks. Specifically, we formulate the problem as finding summaries for each group such that a powerful classifier can distinguish them from documents belonging to\nar X\niv :1\n81 2.\n02 17\n1v 2\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\nJ an\n2 02\n0\nother groups, but cannot distinguish them from documents belonging to the same group. We show how this framework encompasses an existing nearest neighbour objective for summarisation, and propose two new objectives based on the maximum mean discrepancy (Gretton et al. 2012) \u2013 mmd-diff which emphasises classification accuracy and mmd-div which emphasises summary diversity \u2013 as well as new gradientbased optimisation strategies for these objectives. A key advantage of our discriminative problem setting is that it allows summarisation to be evaluated as a classification task. To this end, we design automatic and crowd-sourced evaluations for comparative summaries, which we apply on a new dataset of three ongoing controversial news topics. We observe that the new objectives with gradient optimisation are top-performing in 14 out of 24 settings (across news topics, summary size, and classifiers) (\u00a76.2). We design a new crowd-sourced article classification task for human evaluation. We find that workers are on average 7% more accurate in classifying articles using summaries generated by mmd-diff with gradient-based optimisation than all alternatives. Interestingly, our results contrast with the body of work on dataset selection and summarisation that favour discrete greedy optimisation of submodular objectives due to approximation guarantees. We hypothesise that the comparative summarisation problem is particularly amenable to gradient-based optimisation due to the small number of prototypes needed. Moreover, gradient-based approaches can further improve solutions found by greedy approaches.\nIn sum, the main contributions of this work are: \u2022 A new formulation of comparative document summarisation in terms of competing binary classifiers, two new objectives based on this formulation, and their corresponding gradient-based optimisation strategies.\n\u2022 Design of a scalable automatic and human evaluation methodology for comparative summarisation models, with results showing that the newobjectives out-perform existing submodular objectives.\n\u2022 A use case of comparatively summarising articles over time from a news topic on a new dataset1 of three controversial news topics from 2017 to 2018."

      "text": "The broader context of this work is extractive summarisation. Approaches to this problem include incorporating diversity measures from information-retrieval (Carbonell andGoldstein 1998), structured SVM regularised by constraints for diversity, coverage, and balance (Li et al. 2009), or topic models for summarisation (Haghighi and Vanderwende 2009). Time-aware summarisation is an emerging subproblem, where the current focus is on modeling continuity (Ren et al. 2016) or continuously updating summaries (R\u00fcckl\u00e9 and Gurevych 2017), rather than formulating comparisons. (Li, Li, and Li 2012; Wang et al. 2012) present methods to extract one or few discriminative sentences from a small multi-document corpus utilising greedy optimisation and evaluating qualitatively.\n1Code, datasets and a supplementary appendix are available at https://github.com/computationalmedia/compsumm\n(Huang, Wan, and Xiao 2011) compares descriptions about similar concepts in closely related document pairs, leveraging an integer linear program and evaluating with few manually created ground truth summaries. While these works exist in the domain of comparative summarisation, they are either specific to a data domain or have evaluations which are hard to scale up. In this paper we present approaches to comparative summarisation with intuition from competing binary classifiers, leading to different objectives and evaluation. We demonstrate and evaluate the application of these approaches to multiple data domains such as images and text. Submodular functions have been the preferred form of discrete objectives for summarising text (Lin and Bilmes 2011), images (Simon, Snavely, and Seitz 2007) and data subset selection (Wei, Iyer, and Bilmes 2015; Mitrovic et al. 2018), since they can be optimised greedily with tightlybounded guarantees. The topic of interpreting dataset and models use similar strategies (Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016; Bien and Tibshirani 2011). This work re-investigates classic continuous optimisation for comparative summarisation, and puts it back on the map as a competitive strategy.\n3 Comparative Summarisation as Classification\nFormally, the comparative summarisation problem is defined on G groups of document collections {X1, . . . ,XG}, where a group may, for example, correspond to news articles about a specific topic published in a certain month. We write the document collection for group g as\nXg = {xg,1,xg,2, . . . ,xg,Ng}\nwhere Ng is the total number of documents in group g. We represent individual documents as vector xg,i \u2208 Rd (see \u00a76). Our goal is to summarise each document collection Xg with a set of summary documents or prototypes X\u0304g \u2282 Xg, written X\u0304g = {x\u0304g,1, x\u0304g,2, . . . , x\u0304g,M} For simplicity, we assume the number of prototypes M is the same for each group. The selected prototypes should represent the documents in the group achieving coverage (Figure 2a) and diversity (Figure 2c), while simultaneously discriminating documents from other groups (Figure 2b). For example, if we have news articles on theClimate Change topic then they may discuss the paris agreement in February, coral bleaching in March, and rising sea levels in both months. A comparative summary should include documents about the paris agreement in February and coral bleaching in March, but potentially not on rising sea levels as they are common to both time ranges and hence do not discriminate."

To do so, let us re-interpret the two defining characteristics of prototypes X\u0304g for the gth group: (i) they must represent the documents belonging to that\ngroup. Intuitively, this means that each x\u0304g,i \u2208 X\u0304g must be indistinguishable from all xg,j \u2208 Xg .\nPreviously selected prototype\nCurrent test prototype\n(a) Coverage is the average similarity between the test prototype document and all other documents in the test documents\u2019s group.\nPreviously selected prototype\nCurrent test prototype\n(b) Discriminativeness is the average similarity between the test prototype document and all documents not in the test document\u2019s group.\nPreviously selected prototype\nCurrent test prototype\n(c) Diversity is the average dissimilarity between the test prototype document and all selected prototypes in the test document\u2019s group.\nFigure 2: Illustration of coverage, discriminativeness and diversity criteria for selecting prototypes. The two document groups are shown as blue circles and red squares. The dotted lines represent comparisons between pairs of documents.\n(ii) they must discriminate against documents from all other groups. Intuitively, this means that each x\u0304g,i \u2208 X\u0304g must be distinguishable from x\u00acg,j \u2208 X\u00acg , where X\u00acg denotes the set of all documents belonging to all groups except g.\nThis lets us relate prototype selection to the familiar binary classification problem: for a good set of prototypes, (a) there cannot exist a classifier that can accurately discrim-\ninate between them and documents from that group. For example, even a powerful classifier should not be able to discriminate prototype documents about the Great Barrier Reef from other documents about the Great Barrier Reef.\n(b) there must exist a classifier that can accurately discriminate them against documents from all other groups. For example, a reasonable classifier should be able to discriminate prototypes about the Great Barrier Reef from documents about emission targets.\nConsequently, we can think of prototype selection in terms of two competing binary classification objectives: one distinguishing X\u0304g from Xg, and another distinguishing X\u0304g from X\u00acg . In abstract, this suggests a multi-objective optimisation problem of the form\nmax X\u03041,...,X\u0304G ( G\u2211 g=1 \u2212Acc(X\u0304g,Xg), G\u2211 g=1 Acc(X\u0304g,X\u00acg) ) ,\n(1) where Acc(X,Y) estimates the accuracy of the best possible classifier for distinguishing between the datasets X and Y. Making this idea practical requires committing to a particular means of balancing the two competing objectives. More interestingly, one also needs to find a tractable way to estimate Acc(\u00b7, \u00b7): explicitly searching over rich classifiers such as deep neural networks, would lead to a computationally challenging nested optimisation problem.\nIn the following we discuss a set of objective functions that avoid such nested optimisation. We also discuss two simple optimisation strategies for these objectives in \u00a74."

Specifically, a formulation of prototype selection in (Wei, Iyer, and Bilmes 2015) maximises the total similarity of every point to its nearest prototype from the same class:\nUnn(X\u0304) = G\u2211 g=1 Ng\u2211 i=1 max m\u2208{1,...,M} Sim(x\u0304g,m,xg,i) (2)\nHere, Sim is any similarity function, with admissible choices including a negative distance, or valid kernel functions. The nearest neighbour utility function is simple and intuitive. However, it only considers the most similar prototype for each datapoint which misses our second desirable property of prototypes: that they explicitly distinguish between different classes. Moreover, the nearest neighbour utility function can be challenging to optimise because of the max function. The rest of this section introduces three other utilities that address these concerns."

      "text": "Themaximum mean discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al. 2012) measures the distance between two distributions by leveraging the kernel trick (Sch\u00f6lkopf and Smola 2002). Intuitively, MMD deems two distributions to be close if themean of every function in some rich class F is close under both distributions. For suitable F, this is equivalent to comparing the moments of the two distributions; however, a na\u00efve implementation of this idea would require a prohibitive number of evaluations. Fortunately, choosing F to be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with kernel function k(\u00b7, \u00b7) leads to an expression that is defined only in terms of document interactions via the kernel function (Gretton et al. 2012):\nMMD2(X,Y) =Ex,x\u2032 [k(x,x\u2032)]\u2212 2 \u00b7 Ex,y[k(x,y)]+ Ey,y\u2032 [k(y,y\u2032)] (3)\nwhere x \u223c X,y \u223c Y are observations from two datasets X,Y.

      "text": "One can think of MMD as implicitly computing a (kernelised) nearest centroid classifier to distinguish between X and Y: MMD is small when this classifier has high expected error. Thus, MMD can be seen as an efficient approximation to classification accuracy Acc(\u00b7, \u00b7). This intuition lead to a practical utility function that approximates Equation 1 by taking the difference of two MMD terms:\nUdiff(X\u0304) = \u2211 g(\u2212MMD 2(X\u0304g,Xg) + \u03bb \u00b7MMD2(X\u0304g,X\u00acg)) (5)\nThe hyper-parameter \u03bb trades off how well the prototype represents its group, against how well it distinguishes between groups (Figure 2b). Intuitively, when the term MMD2(X\u0304g,X\u00acg) is large then the prototypes X\u0304g are dissimilar from documents X\u00acg of other groups. Similarly, when MMD2(X\u0304g,Xg) is small then the prototypes are similar to documents of that group. Maximising \u2212MMD2 gives prototypes that are both close to the empirical samples (as seen by the Ex,y term in Equation 3 and illustrated by Figure 2a) and far from one another (as seen by the Ey,y\u2032 term and illustrated by Figure 2c).\nWhile the objective of Equation 5 provides the core of our approach, we also present a variant that increases the diversity of prototypes chosen for each group. A closer examination of the difference of MMD2 in Equation 5 \u2013 by expanding both using Equation 3 \u2013 reveals two separate prototype diversity terms \u2212Ex\u0304g,x\u0304\u2032g [k(x\u0304g, x\u0304 \u2032 g)] and \u03bbEx\u0304g,x\u0304\u2032g [k(x\u0304g, x\u0304 \u2032 g)]. The latter counteracts the former and decreases prototype diversity (details in Appendix1). On the expanded form of \u03bbMMD2(X\u0304g,X\u00acg), we remove the terms not involving x\u0304g, as they are constants and have no effect on the solution, and also remove the conflicting diversity term\u03bbEx\u0304g,x\u0304\u2032g [k(x\u0304g, x\u0304 \u2032 g)]. This gives a new objective:\nUdiv(X\u0304) = \u2211 g(\u2212MMD 2(X\u0304g,Xg)\u2212 2\u03bbEx\u0304g,x\u00acg [k(x\u0304g,x\u00acg)]) (6)\nMaximising \u2212\u03bbEx\u0304g,x\u00acg [k(x\u0304g,x\u00acg)] encourages prototypes in group g to be far from data points in other groups.\nOne can envision another variant that explicitly optimises the diversity between prototypes of different classes, rather than between prototypes of class g against data points in other classes. This is computationally more efficient, and reflects similar intuitions. However, it did not outperformUdiff,Udiv in summarisation tasks, and is omitted due to space limitations.\nDifferences to related objectives. The nearest-neighbour objective was articulated in (Wei, Iyer, and Bilmes 2015) and earlier in (Bien and Tibshirani 2011), and used for classification tasks. Recently, (Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016) proposedMMD-critic, which selects prototypes X\u0304 for a single group of documents X by maximizing\u2212MMD2(X\u0304,X). The first term in Equation 5 builds on this formulation, applying this idea independently for each group. Our second term is crucial to encourage prototypes that only represent their own group and none of the other groups. MMD-critic also containsmodel criticisms, which have to be optimized sequentially after obtaining prototypes. As shown in \u00a76,MMD-critic under-performs in comparison tasks by a significant margin.\n4 Optimising Utility Functions There are two general strategies for optimising the utility functions outlined in \u00a73 to generate summaries that are a subset of the original dataset: greedy and gradient optimisation. Greedy optimisation. The first strategy involves directly choosingM prototypes for each group. Obtaining the exact solution to this discrete optimisation problem is intractable; however, approximations such as greedy selection can work well in practice, and may also have theoretical guarantees.\nSpecifically, suppose we wish to maximise a utility set function F : 2|V | \u2192 R defined on ground set V . For S \u2282 V and s \u2208 V \\ S, the marginal gain of adding element s to an existing set S is known as the discrete derivative, and is defined by \u2206F (s|S) = F (S \u222a s) \u2212 F (S). We say F is monotone if and only if the discrete derivatives are nonnegative, i.e. \u2206F (s|S) \u2265 0, and is submodular if and only if the marginal gain satisfies diminishing returns, i.e. for S \u2286 T \u2282 V, s \u2208 V \\T , \u2206F (s|S) \u2265 \u2206F (s|T ). (Nemhauser, Wolsey, and Fisher 1978) showed that if F is submodular and monotone, greedy maximisation of F yields an approximate solution no worse than 1\u2212 1e \u2248 0.63 of the optimal solution under cardinality and matroid constraints. (Lin and Bilmes 2010) showed this approximation holds with high probability even for non-monotone submodular objectives. In our context, given a utility function U, the greedy algorithm (see Appendix1) works by iteratively picking the xg that provides the largest marginal gain (\u2206U(xg|X\u0304g)) one at a time for each group. Among the utility functions mentioned in \u00a73, the nearest-neighbour objective Unn is submodular-monotone (Wei, Iyer, and Bilmes 2015). The MMD function in Equation 3 is submodular-monotone under mild assumptions on the kernel matrix (Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016). The MMD objective Udiff is the difference between two submodular-monotone functions, which is not submodular in general. On the other hand, the second term in Udiv is modular with respect to X\u0304g, when the number of prototypes M fixed and known in advance. Therefore, the diversity objectiveUdiv is the difference between a submodular function and a modular function, and thus submodular. Gradient optimisation The second strategy is to re-cast the problem to allow for continuous optimisation in the feature space, e.g. using standard gradient descent. To generate prototypes, the solutions to this optimisation can then be snapped to the nearest data points as a post-processing step.\nConcretely, rather than searching for optimal prototypes X\u0304g directly, we seek \u201cmeta-prototypes\u201d A\u0304g = {a\u0304g,1, . . . , a\u0304g,M}, drawn from the same space as the document embeddings. We now modify Udiff (Equation 5) to incorporate \u201cmetaprototypes\u201d. Note that Udiv can be similarly modified, but Unn cannot, since the max function is not differentiable. The \u201cmeta-prototypes\u201d for Udiff are chosen to optimise\nmax A\u03041,...,A\u0304G \u2211 g (\u2212MMD2(A\u0304g,Xg) + \u03bb \u00b7MMD2(A\u0304g,X\u00acg)) (7)\nThe only difference to Equation 5 is that we do not enforce that A\u0304g \u2282 Xg . This subtle, but significant, difference allows Equation 7 to be optimized using gradient-following methods. We use L-BFGS (Byrd et al. 1995) with analytical gradients found in online appendix1. The selected meta-prototypes A\u0304g are then snapped to the nearest document in the group: to construct the ith prototype for the gth group, we find\nx\u0304g,i = argmin x\ng,j \u2208X g\n\u2016a\u0304g,i \u2212 xg,j\u201622. (8)\nOn a problem often tackled with discrete greedy optimisation, one may wonder if gradient-based methods can be competitive; we answer this in the affirmative in our experiments."

      "text": "Exploring the evolution of controversial news topics is a natural application of comparative summarisation. Comparative summarisation could help to better understand the role of news media in such a setting. Recent work on controversial topics (Garimella et al. 2018) focused on the social network and interaction around controversial topics, but did not explicitly consider the content of news articles on these topics. To this end, we curate a set of news articles on long-running controversial topics using tweets which link to news articles. We choose several long-running controversial topics with significant news coverage in 2017 and 2018. To find articles relevant to these topics we use keywords to filter the Twitter stream, and adopt a snowball strategy to add additional keywords (Verkamp and Gupta 2013). The articles linked in these tweets are then de-duplicated and filtered for spam. Article timestamps correspond to the creation time of the first tweet linking to it. Full details of the data collection procedure are described in online appendix1. In this work, we use news articles on three topics that appeared in a 14 month period (June 2017 \u2013 July 2018). Within each topic we comparatively summarise news articles in different time periods to identify what has changed in that topic between the summarisation periods. To ensure our method works on a range of topics we chose substantially different long running topics: Beef Ban \u2013 controversy over the slaughter and sale of beef on religious grounds (1543 articles) is localised to a particular region, mainly Indian subcontinent, while Gun Control \u2013 restrictions on carrying, using, or purchasing firearms (6494 articles) and Capital Punishment \u2013 use of the death penalty (7905 articles) are topical in various regions around the world. Figure 3 shows the number of new articles on each topic over time.\n6 Experiments and Results We evaluate approaches to comparative summarisation using both automatic and crowd-sourced human classification tasks. This choice stems from with our classification perspective (see \u00a73.1), and has been used in the prototype selection literature (Bien and Tibshirani 2011; Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016). Intuitively, a good set of prototype articles should uniquely identify a new article\u2019s group. Datasets and features. We empirically validate classification and prototype selection methods on a well known USPS dataset (Bien and Tibshirani 2011; Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016). USPS contains 16\u00d7 16 grayscale handwritten digits in 10 classes (i.e., digits 0 through 9). To reduce the dimensionality we use PCA, projecting the 256 dimensional image vectors into 39 features that explain 85% of the variance. The USPS dataset provides 7291 training and 2007 test images. We generate another 9 random splits with exactly the same number of training and test images for the purposes of estimating confidence intervals. In using the USPS dataset our aims are twofold. First, it shows the versatility of the method: the domain need not be text, collections need not be separated by time, and it operates with more than two classes. Indeed, by thinking of each digit as a group, our method can identify representative and diverse examples of digits. Second, ourmethod can be seen as a special kind of prototype selection for which the USPS dataset has been used as a standard benchmark (Bien and Tibshirani 2011; Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016). We further use the controversial news dataset described in \u00a75 to evaluate comparative summarisation. We adopt the pre-trained GloVe-300 (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014) vector representation for each word, and then represent the article as an average of the word vectors from its the title and first 3 sentences \u2013 the most important text due to the inverted pyramid structure in news style (P\u00f6ttker 2003). This feature performs competitively in retrieval tasks despite its simplicity (Joulin et al. 2016). For each news topic, we generate 10 random splits with 80% training articles and 20% test articles for automatic evaluation. One of these splits is used for human evaluation. Approaches and baselines. We compare: \u2022 nn-comp-greedy represents the nearest neighbour objective Unn, optimised in a greedy manner.\n\u2022 mmd-diff represents the difference of MMD objective Udiff.\nmmd-diff-grad uses gradient based optimisationwhilemmddiff-greedy is optimised greedily.\n\u2022 mmd-div-grad and mmd-div-greedy are the gradient-based and greedy variants of the diverse MMD objective Udiv.\nwith three baseline approaches: \u2022 kmeans clusters with kmeans++ initialisation (Arthur and Vassilvitskii 2007) found separately for each document group. TheM cluster centers for each group are snapped to the nearest data point using Equation 8.\n\u2022 kmedoids (Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1987) clustering algorithm with kmeans++ initialisation, computed separately for each document group. The medoids become the prototypes themselves.\n\u2022 mmd-critic (Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016) selects prototypes using greedy optimisation of MMD2 and criticisms by choosing points that deviate from the prototypes. The summary is selected from the unlabeled training set and consists of prototypes and criticisms in a one-to-one ratio. We use the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel when applicable. The hyper-parameter \u03b3 is chosen along with the trade-off factor \u03bb, and SVM soft margin C using grid search 3 fold cross-validation on the training set. Note that 1NN has no tunable parameters. The grad optimisation approach uses the L-BFGS algorithm (Byrd et al. 1995), with initial prototype guesses chosen by the greedy algorithm for news dataset and K-means for USPS dataset."

      "text": "The controversial news dataset topics are divided into two groups of equal duration based on article timestamp. Note that typically the number of documents in each time range is imbalanced. The USPS hand written digits dataset is divided into 10 groups corresponding to the 10 different digits. On\neach training split we select the prototypes for each group and then train an SVM or 1NN on the set of prototypes.\nWe measure the classifier performance on the test set using balanced accuracy, defined as the average accuracy of all classes (Brodersen et al. 2010). For binary classification this is 12 ( TP P + TN N ), defined in terms of total positives P, total negatives N, true negatives TN, and true positives TP. Balanced accuracy accounts for class imbalance, and is applicable to both binary and multi-class classification tasks (whereas AUC and average precision are not). For all approaches, we report the mean and 95% confidence interval of the 10 random splits.\nWe report results on 2, 4, 8, or 16 prototypes per group \u2013 a small number of prototypes is necessary for the summaries to bemeaningful to humans. This is in contrast to the hundreds of prototypes used by (Bien and Tibshirani 2011; Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016), in automatic evaluations of the predictive quality of prototypes."

      "text": "Figure 4 reports balanced accuracy for all methods using SVM and 1-NN across different datasets and numbers of prototypes. On the USPS dataset, most methods perform well. The differences are small, if at all distinguishable. mmd-critic performs poorly onUSPS; this is because it does not guarantee a fixed number of prototypes per group, and sometimesmisses a group all together. Note that this is very unlikely to occur with only 2 groups in the news dataset.\nOn the three news datasets, comparative summaries based on mmd objectives are the best-performing approach in 20 out of 24 evaluations (2 classifiers x 4 prototype sizes x 3 news topics (details in Appendix1) . In the remaining two cases, they are the second-best with overlapping confidence intervals against the best (kmeans). Despite the lack of optimisation guarantees, grad optimisation produces prototypes of better\nquality in 14 out of 24 settings. Generally, all methods produce better classification accuracy as the number of prototypes increases. This indicates that the chosen prototypes do introduce new information that helps with the classification. In the limit, where all documents are selected as prototypes \u2013 a setting that is clearly unreasonable when summarisation is the goal \u2013 the performance is determined by the classifier alone. SVM achieves 0.763 on Capital Punishment and Beef Ban, 0.707 on Gun Control, while 1-NN achieves 0.762 on Capital Punishment, 0.763 on Beef Ban and 0.702 on Gun Control. As seen in Figure 4 no prototype selection method approaches this accuracy. This highlights the difficulty of selecting only a few prototypes to represent complex distributions of news articles over time."

      "text": "We conduct a user study on the crowd-sourcing platform figure-eight2 with two questions in mind: (1) using article classification accuracy as a proxy, do people perform similarly to automatic evaluation? (2) how useful do people find the comparative summaries? This is an acid test on providing value to users who need comprehend large document corpora. Human evaluations in this work are designed to grade our method in a real world task: accurately identifying a news articles group (e.g. the month it is published) given only a few (4) articles from each month. The automatic evaluations in \u00a76.2 are instructive proxies for efficacy, but inherently incomplete without human evaluation. Generating summaries for the crowd. We present summaries from four methods kmeans, nn-comp-greedy, mmddiff-greedy, andmmd-diff-grad \u2013 chosen because they perform well in automatic evaluation and together form a cross-section of different method types. We opt to vary the groups of news articles being summarised by choosing many pairs of time ranges, since summaries on the same pair of groups (by definition) tend to be very similar or identical, which incurs user fatigue. We use the Beef Ban topic because it has the longest time range: June 2017 to July 2018 inclusive. The articles are grouped into each of the 14 months, and then 91 (i.e., 14 choose 2) pairs are formed. We take the top 10 pairs by performance according automatic evaluation using each of the four approaches, the union of these lead to 21 pairs. We pick top-performing pairs because preliminary human experiments showed that humans seem unable to classify an article when automatic results do poorly (e.g. <0.65 in balanced accuracy). Articles from each of the 21 pairs of months are randomly split into training and testing sets. We ask participants to classify six randomly sampled test articles. To reduce evaluation variance, all methods share the same test articles, different methods are randomized and are blind to workers. We record three independent judgments for each (test article, month-pair) tuple \u2013 totaling 1,512 judgments from 126 test questions over four methods. We also restrict the crowd workers to be from India, where Beef Ban is locally relevant, and workers will be familiar with the people, places and organisations mentioned news articles. Questionnaire design. Figure 5 shows the questionnaires\n2https://www.figure-eight.com\nwe designed for human evaluation. Each questionnaire has 4 parts: (a) instructions, (b) two groups of prototypes, (c) test articles that must be classified into a group, and (c) a comment box for free-form feedback. In the instruction (a), we explain that the two groups of representative articles (the prototypes for each time range) are articles from different time ranges and lay out the steps to complete the questionnaire. We ask participants not to use external sources to help classify test articles.\nThe two groups of prototype articles (b) are chosen by one of the method being evaluated (e.g.,mmd-diff-grad or kmeans) from articles in two different time ranges. Each group has four representative articles and each article has a title and a couple of sentences to help understand the content. We assign a different background colour to each group of summaries to give participants a visual guide.\nBelow the groups of summary articles are three questions (c), though for brevity only two are shown in Figure 5. Each question asks participants to decide which of the two time ranges a test article belongs to. We add a comment box (d) to gather free-form feedback fromparticipants. This helps to quickly uncover problemswith the task, provides valuable insight into how participants use the summaries to make their choices, and gives an indication of how difficult users find the task. As a quality-control measure, we include questions with known ground truth amongst the test questions. These ground truth questions are manually curated and reviewed if many workers fail on them. Each unit of work includes 4 questionnaires (of 3 questions\neach), one of which is a group of ground truth questions randomly positioned. Note that ground truth questions are only used to filter out participants and are not included in the evaluation results."

The number of unique participants answering test questions ranged from 25 to 31 for each method, indicating that the results were not dominated a small number of participants. On average, participants spent 51 seconds on each test question and 2 minutes 33 seconds on each summary. Quantitative results Figure 6 shows that on average crowd workers with mmd-diff-grad summaries classify an article more accurately than summaries from other approaches by at least 7%. The results are statistically significant with p < 0.05 under a one sided sign test; which applies because the 126 test questions where answered by three random people and we cannot assume normality. It also has the highest number of consensus correct judgments (details in Appendix1). mmddiff-greedy performs worse than mmd-diff-grad.\nWe also compute the Fleiss Kappa statistic to measure interannotator agreement. The statistics are: 0.418 for kmeans, 0.456 formmd-diff-grad, 0.435 for nn-comp-greedy, and 0.483 for mmd-diff-greedy and a combined statistic of 0.451. All statistics fall into the range of moderate agreement (Landis and Koch 1977), which means the results we obtain in crowdsourced evaluations are reliable. The good performance of gradient-based optimisation is surprising given greedy approaches are usually preferred in subset selection tasks, due to approximation guarantees for submodular objectives. One plausible explanation is that early prototypes selected by greedy tend to cluster around the first prototype, whereas the simultaneous optimisation in grad tend to spread prototypes in feature space. With only four prototypes being shown to users, diversity is an important factor for human classification. Previous studies of greedy methods for prototype selection have used hundreds of prototypes (Bien and Tibshirani 2011) \u2013 a setting in which the diversity of the early prototypes matters less \u2013 or\nused criticisms (Kim, Khanna, and Koyejo 2016) to improve diversity in tandem.\nComparing Figure 6 (a) \u2013 (c), automatic classifiers trained on both the entire training set and prototypes have higher classification accuracy than humanworkers across allmethods. This observation indicates that using summaries to classify articles is difficult for humans. It could also indicate that humans use different features for article grouping, and word vectors alone may not capture those features. Qualitative observations. Results from the optional freeform comments show that the participants found the classification difficulty to vary wildly. While some sets of articles were apparently easy to classify (e.g., \u201cGroup articles are distinct in their manner, among which all are articles are easy to determine.\"), other articles were difficult to classify (e.g., \u201cAlthough two groups are clearly distinct, this one (news article) was pretty difficult to ascertain in which group it belongs to.\") In some cases poor summaries seem to have made the task exceedingly difficult; e.g., \u201cQ1, Q2, Q3 all are not belongs to group 1 and group 2 any topic I think.\" (quoted verbatim).\nWe found that the Beef Ban topic interested many of our participants, with some expressing their views on the summarised articles, for example \u201cFirstly we should define what is beef ..is it a cow or any animal?\" and \u201cIt is a broad matter, what we should eat or not, it cannot be decided by government.\" (edited for clarity). Participant comments also give some insight into what features were used to make classification. In particular, word and entity matching were frequently mentioned, a representative user comment is \u201cNone of the questions match the given article, but I had to go by words used.\" All crowd-sourced evaluation results and comments are available in the dataset github repository1.\n7 Conclusion\nWe formulated the comparative document summarisation in terms of competing binary classifiers. This inspired new MMD based objectives amenable to both gradient and greedy optimisation. Moreover, the setting enabled us to design efficient automatic and human evaluations to compare different objectives and optimisation methods on a new, highly relevant dataset of news articles. We found that our new MMD approaches, optimised by gradient methods, frequently outperformed all alternatives, including the greedy approaches currently favoured by the literature. Future work can include new use cases for comparative summarisation, such as authors or view points; richer text features; extensions to cross-modal comparative summarisation.\nAcknowledgements.
