      "text": "Background: Elderly ICU patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) have a high risk of death therefore early detection is critical for an improved prognosis. The performance of current scoring systems used to assess the severity of MODS lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to accurately guide clinicians\u2019 actions. This study aims to develop an interpretable and generalizable model with superior performance for early mortality prediction in elderly patients with MODS. Methods: The MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD and PLAGH-S databases (with 57,786, 200,859 and 1,462 unique ICU admissions, respectively) were employed for model generation and evaluation. We used the machine learning model XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) with the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to conduct early and interpretable predictions of patients\u2019 hospital outcome. Three types of data source combinations (from single center, multicenter and the fusion of both) and five typical evaluation indexes (AUC, sensitivity, specificity, F1 and accuracy) were adopted to develop a generalizable model. Findings: The interpretable model, with optimal performance developed by using MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets, was separately validated in MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD and PLAGH-S datasets (no overlapping with training set). The performances of the model in predicting hospital mortality as validated by the three datasets were: AUC of 0\u00b7858, sensitivity of 0\u00b7834 and specificity of 0\u00b7705; AUC of 0\u00b7849, sensitivity of 0\u00b7763 and specificity of 0\u00b7784; and AUC of 0\u00b7838, sensitivity of 0\u00b7882 and specificity of 0\u00b7691, respectively. Comparisons of AUC (95% CI) between this model and baseline models with MIMIC-III dataset validation showed superior performances of this model (0\u00b7858 [0\u00b7841 - 0\u00b7875] vs. 0\u00b7854 [0\u00b7838 - 0\u00b7871], 0\u00b7834 [0\u00b7817 - 0\u00b7853], 0\u00b7824 [0\u00b7804 - 0\u00b7844], 0\u00b7788 [0\u00b7766 - 0\u00b7810] and 0\u00b7741 [0\u00b7716 - 0\u00b7765] compared with LR, NN, SVM, RF and NB, respectively); In addition, comparisons in AUC between this model and commonly used clinical scores showed significantly better performance of this model (0\u00b7858 [0\u00b7841 - 0\u00b7875] vs. 0\u00b7752 [0\u00b7729 - 0\u00b7776], 0\u00b773 [0\u00b7704 - 0\u00b7757], 0\u00b7694 [0\u00b7669 - 0\u00b7719], 0\u00b7686 [0\u00b7659 - 0\u00b7713] and 0\u00b7668 [0\u00b7639 - 0\u00b7697] compared with OASIS, APSIII, MODS, SAPS and SOFA, respectively). Interpretation: The interpretable machine learning model developed in this study using fused datasets with large sample sizes was robust and generalizable. This model outperformed the baseline models and several clinical scores for early prediction of mortality in elderly ICU patients. The interpretative nature of this model provided clinicians with the ranking of mortality risk features and the rationale for assessing the patient\u2019s mortality risk probability.\n2"

      "heading": "Introduction",
      "text": "Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a continuous process with physiologic derangement in more than one organ,1 and its leading culprits include infection, injury, hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism status, etc..2 The high morbidity and mortality, as well as the substantial medical expenses in patients who are admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and encounter MODS, have been a very challenging issue.1,3 It should be noted that elderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) with MODS have a significantly higher mortality risk compared with younger patients due to their fragile health status and potential comorbidities.4,5 A prior study reported that the mortality risk in elderly patients suffering from multiple organ (over three) failure could be up to 50% ~ 100%.6 Moreover, even if they survived, the need for long-term clinical care and organ function support treatment would be a heavy financial burden that is hardly bearable.7,8 Therefore, early assessment of organ failure severity and mortality prediction in elderly patients with MODS are of vital importance in giving clinicians more time to respond by providing individualized clinical and nursing care. Since 1980, extensive studies on clinical scores evaluating the risk of death based on patient\u2019s organ function or severity of illness have been carried out. These include the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score established by Knaus et al,9 followed by the modified score of the APACHE III prognostic system developed in 1991,10 Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) including 17 variables (19 variables in the APACHE-III) in assessing the severity of organ failure proposed by Le Gall et al,11 Multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) by Marshall et al,12 and the widely recognized Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score developed by Vincent et al.13 However, a growing body of literature has demonstrated that the scores mentioned above failed to accurately assess and predict the risk of death14 for the following reasons: 1) the factors and their assigned weights according to a panel of experts\u2019 experience could not fully reflect the characteristic of a larger population;15,16 2) the individual linear addition of each organ system could not represent the complex situation and the intrinsic correlations of organ systems;16 and 3) they were not adequately calibrated in multicenter and large sample cohorts.15 Recently, the availability of electronic health records (EHR) data has allowed researchers to focus on developing machine learning algorithms for powerful analysis of complex and heterogeneous data and sophisticated modeling capacity.17 The OASIS severity score, designed by Johnson et.al, was a novel illness scale using part of the variables from APACHE-III and particle swarm optimization algorithm to achieve an effective prediction of mortality and length of hospitalization.18 The Super ICU Learner Algorithm (SICULA) was proposed by Romain et al to improve mortality prediction,15 which adopted an ensemble machine learning method with a better predictive performance than those obtained from scoring systems. However, these scores or algorithms focus solely on adult ICU patients and lack sufficient samples for external validation of the model. Specifically, SICULA can only provide clinicians with risk probability but not the rationale for the assessment. Targeting this, Benjamin et. al developed an acuity assessing score, DeepSOFA, using deep learning methods.19 With the same elements as a SOFA score, it was more optimal in evaluating disease severity by providing clinicians with a more accurate mortality prediction than its predecessor. However, it only included limited information without exploring other potentially meaningful factors for diagnosis. Meanwhile, the model was developed based on a local database and validated in a public single-center database from the same country, without further analysis on how to get a robust and universal prediction model. A Meyer et. al also employed deep learning methods to develop a real-time model of serious complications including mortality.20 While it performed well, it is a black box to clinicians. Moreover,\n3 so far, few research studies focusing on elderly patients with MODS have been conducted. In this paper, we aim to develop a prediction model to assist clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of this specific elderly population admitted to the ICU. With rigorous methodology, we propose an efficient way to acquire a robust and generalizable model, which is then validated in multicenter and cross-country datasets (developed: US, developing: China) with large sample sizes. The assessment of the degree of nervous system damage, as indicated in Glasgow coma score (GCS), was found to deserve more attention from clinicians. Likewise, two important risk factors, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and shock index (SI), which are largely ignored in current commonly-used clinical scores, were identified to be highly relevant to patient mortality. The proposed model with interpretability can help clinicians better understand the decision-making process in the assessment of disease severity and take full advantage of any opportunities for early intervention."

PLAGH-S is a surgical ICU database under development from the General Hospital of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLAGH), a tertiary hospital integrating high-level education and research in China. We utilized data from 1,102 patients in 2017 and 2018, in which the identification information of patients was removed similar to the MIMIC-III database. These three databases (MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD and PLAGH-S) contain all medical records of patients during their ICU stay, typically including demographic information, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, diagnoses, orders, notes, input and output information. It is worth mentioning that there might be variations in the method and frequency of vital sign data. For the eICU-CRD database, vital signs of periodic monitoring by machine were automatically interfaced, stored archived with a median interval of five minutes. In the MIMIC-III and PLAGH-S database, the vital sign values were recorded and confirmed by nurses. The recording frequency depends on the patient\u2019s disease severity. When the patient\u2019s condition was not stable, the nurse would record once every 5 to 15 minutes. Otherwise, it was usually recorded once per hour. Contents in this study involving MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD databases was an analysis of a third-party anonymized publicly available database with pre-existing institutional review board (IRB) approval.

Thousands of decision trees, weak learners generated with this method, are composed into strong learners using gradient boosting approach to iteratively train and optimize the parameters. In order to get a universal and robust prediction model, we explored the impact of different types of data sources on model performance. Considering the small samples size of the PLAGH-S cohort, it was suitable as a test set for evaluation. Therefore, we employed three models displayed in Figure 1. Model 1 was developed using 80% of a cohort randomly selected from the MIMIC-III database, which represented a single center database. Model 2 was developed from the eICU-CRD database using the same methods, which results in cohorts of patients from multiple centers. Model 3 was developed from the combined data from Models 1 and 2, which comprised a larger sample size and longer time span. For each model, the cross-validation process was not carried out in this paper owing to its large sample sets.

We adopt \u2018Model3\u2019 as our optimal early risk prediction model to assess patient outcome. Figure 3(a) displays the top 20 risk factors in our model. The features ranking (y axis) implies the importance of the prediction model. The SHAP value (x axis) is a unified index responding to the impact of a feature in the model. In each feature importance row, all patients\u2019 attribution to outcome were plotted using different color dots, in which the red (blue) dot represented high (low) value. Figure 3(b) shows the top 20 most important features evaluated by the average of absolute SHAP value. Risk factors such as GCS (max, avg and min), Respiratory Rate (rr: avg), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN: min), age, shock index (si: avg), SIRS score (avg), total urine output of 24 hours (uo) and Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2: min) during the initial 24 hours of ICU stay were ranked as the ten most important factors. The most important feature of GCS is to emphasize the nervous system as the most crucial for early assessment of patient\u2019s status than other organ systems. BUN level was found to be a key factor, which is easily overlooked by clinicians. Figure 3(c) provides two typical relative samples to illustrate the interpretability of the model. Although the patient had normal urine output (2825 ml), BMI (31\u00b74 kg/m2) and SpO2 (98\u00b776 %), he died due to poor GCS (7 points), high BUN (59 mg/dL) and FiO2\n10\n(60 %). While the survivor had normal GCS (15 points), SIRS score (1 point), BUN (9 mg/dL) and no mechanical ventilation need. Although at very high age (87 years old) and had high blood glucose level (148 mg/dL), the patient survived after treatment. The risk factor rankings of \u2018Model 1\u2019 and \u2018Model 2\u2019 can be found in the supplementary files (eFigure 5 and eFigure 6). A summary of three models\u2019 risk factors ranking was presented in eTable 6.

      "text": "In this study, a generalizable and interpretable model for the early prediction of mortality risk in elderly patients with MODS was developed and validated based on three clinical databases, and performed well in the early assessment of organ damage, providing crucial support for clinical decision making. Generally, four part of contributions were accomplished in this study: (1) Comprehensive and reasonable experiments were designed to establish an optimal prediction model with satisfactory performance, utilizing training sets from both single center with long time span and multiple centers with short time span as well as the fusion of both; (2) Multiple methods and indexes were utilized to evaluate the model\u2019s performance, including internal and external validations covering the countries with different levels of economic development. Meanwhile, comparisons with machine learning methods and clinical scores were also included. The indexes adopted were AUC, sensitivity, specificity, F1, accuracy, robustness and universality; (3) The explanation was employed to the black box tree ensemble model of XGBoost, which helps doctors better understand the decision-making process of the model; (4) Key risk factors with robustness and interpretation were acquired. Two important factors of BUN and shock index, significantly correlated to death, also were discovered, which were commonly overlooked by physicians and commonly used clinical scores. Most previous researchers examined the early mortality prediction performance of the proposed models by cross validation limited to their single-center study dataset. Although their models performed well in that setting, their performances in other datasets were not verified. In this study, the model proposed by us was evaluated using large sample-size and multicenter databases, which enabled\n12\nus to accomplish the internal and external validations without overlapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which mortality prediction and assessment models were validated in countries with different economic development levels (US & China). In order to comprehensively evaluate the model\u2019s performance, the commonly used clinical scores and machine learning methods were both included and five measurements were adopted to compare both of them. Moreover, the new score of OASIS, which had been proven to have more concise inputs and better performance compared to the APACHE score was also included for comparison.1829 Finally, our model consistently outperformed all the baseline models and clinical scores (Figure 4, eFigure 8 and eFigure 9). Thus, the model bears great potential to be generalized and applied in clinical practice. Several recent studies have reported their models\u2019 validation performance using multicenter datasets. Matthew MC et al. developed a model using 60% of the data from a multicenter database and evaluated it using the remaining 40% of the data.29 Shamin N et al. utilized a regional clinical database to develop the model and externally validated it utilizing a database from another region.30 Benjamin S et al. adopted their local database to train the model and assessed it with combined internal and external validations.19 Hamid M et al. leveraged three institutional databases and trained one model from each institution which was evaluated using databases from the remaining institutions.31 However, these studies did not specify an approach to get a generalizable and robust model. Thus, we chose the special validation sets where no overlapping exists among training sets to evaluate the models\u2019 performance (accuracy and robustness). The validation sets in our study included 20% of the MIMIC-III cohort, 20% of the eICU-CRD cohort and total cohort of the PLAGH-S. Data used for training were the remaining data from each database, namely MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD, as well as the combination of them. Therefore, three different types of training sets (single-center with long duration, multicenter with short duration and the fusion of them) were analyzed and validated, which enabled us to develop this optimal predictive model. Recently, interest in using the interpretation and tree ensemble models have been growing to develop mortality prediction model, such as RF and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT).29,32,33 Although tree ensemble models are more accurate compared to LR and can provide features importance ranking, it cannot tell clinicians whether the important factors are protective or dangerous like LR dose: the \u2018black-box\u2019 nature of machine learning algorithms can make it difficult to understand and correct errors when they occur.34 Meanwhile, a trade-off between the accuracy and interpretation of the models is often hard to achieve. In addition, the risk probability output of the model is not easily understandable for doctors. Therefore, we applied the proposed SHAP values to the XGBoost, which made our model able to achieve both optimal accuracy and interpretability to provide more insights to doctors. Detailed information was described in results, as well as explanation of risk factors. In summary, given the key risk factors, the model can visually explain to clinicians which specific features of elderly patients with MODS predispose them to high (low) risk of death. Most of the current predictive models based on tree (ensemble) methods generate features important rankings using default parameters of \u2018importance type\u2019. Actually, there are five alternative types available (ie., \u2018weight\u2019, \u2018gain\u2019, \u2018cover\u2019, \u2018total_gain\u2019 and \u2018total_cover\u2019) and the ranking results would be changed when different types were chosen. Top 30 features ranking results in three commonly used types were illustrated in eFigure 14. and eTable 8, which intuitively presented its inconsistency. Different from the previous studies, we adopted the SHAP value, a unified measure, while generating features important ranking. It had been theoretically proven to be an optimal approach and the only possible consistent feature attribution method.28 Its consistency has been proved with the\n13\nsimilar feature ranking even though using the multiple sources of training data in as shown in eTable 9. The key risk factors identified in this study are consistent with clinicians\u2019 prior knowledge. Two statistically significant factors identified, BUN and shock index, ranked fourth and sixth, respectively, were usually overlooked by physicians and contributed in mortality assessment in elderly with MODS. BUN is a laboratory test used to evaluate renal function, a high value of which might be related to renal failure, hypovolemia, congestive heart failure and increased catabolism, etc. However, most of the clinical scores (like SOFA, APACHE-II) only include creatinine level. Recently, several studies found BUN to be an independent factor (biomarker) for mortality in ICU patients, and that it can also indicate the degree of heart failure by reflecting the interaction of nutrition, protein metabolism and renal status.35,36 Okan A et al. found that high BUN level to be indicative of ongoing multi-organ failure.36 While these studies are limited by small sample sets and utilization of early simplified models, results of our study were based on the large sample sets and sophisticated models. Ryan W. H et al. recently reported that persistent elevation of BUN indicates concurrent muscle bioenergetic failure, muscle catabolism/altered protein homeostasis and persistent muscle loss, which further affects the metabolic process and aggravates disease severity.37 Shock index was generally utilized to measure the severity of sepsis and septic shock.38 Some studies also demonstrate it to be a mortality predictor or indicator for certain kinds of diseases.39,40 As for elderly patients suffering from multiple organ dysfunction, our results indicate that shock index could be used as an important factor to predict patient death. Before the study, we speculated that a large proportion of the patients in the dataset would have sepsis or septic shock. Consistently, the sepsis population ratio and its death rate for each study cohort were relatively high (47\u00b708% of sepsis and 8\u00b753% of mortality in the MIMIC-III cohort, 63\u00b760% of sepsis and 9\u00b747% of mortality in the MIMIC-III cohort, and 59\u00b768% of sepsis and 8\u00b789% of mortality in the MIMIC-III cohort). A more in-depth investigation of the disease mechanism warrants further studies. Interestingly, two risk factors, GCS (nervous system) and respiratory rate (respiratory system), ranking No. 1 and 3 respectively, were found to be critical in assessing disease severity, which is consistent to the conclusion of a previous study.19 This finding indicates that the state of the nervous and respiratory systems should be paid more attention to, rather than being treated equally as other systems. For a more comprehensive assessment of our model\u2019s robustness, we selected the top 20 features acquired by SHAP values to train the model, which were evaluated in three study cohorts. Consequently, our model achieved satisfactory performance which outperforms all the commonly used clinical scores. This study has some limitations. Although the predictive model in this study achieved early mortality prediction in elderly patients with MODS, it would be of greater value to accomplish a real-time evaluation of disease severity. Therefore, we plan to leverage the time series models such as long short-term memory (LSTM) to develop real-time prediction models. Moreover, the PLAGH-S database was constructed to facilitate the management of surgical ICU data in our hospital, which is a single ICU dataset compared to the MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD database where all types of ICU wards are included. We evaluated the model using the PLAGH-S\u2019 cohort, which failed to accurately reflect the performance of the model. Therefore, we will further complete data standardization and sort out the cohort from the PLAGH General Intensive Care Unit Database, which contains the hospitalization records of above 66,227 adult patients in nine ICUs in the past ten years. This will allow us to provide readers with more accurate multicenter validation results in different countries. In conclusion, based on the multicenter clinical databases originating from different regions, we established a generalized and interpretable predictive model with optimal performance utilizing the\n14\nfusion data of the MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD cohorts for early evaluation of mortality risk in elderly with MODS. The top ten risk factors with the greatest predictive value are GCS, respiratory rate, BUN, age, shock index, SIRS score, total urine output on the first day in ICU and SpO2. Meanwhile, BUN and shock index are factors worth more attention from clinicians for their predictive value of mortality in elderly patients with organ dysfunction."
