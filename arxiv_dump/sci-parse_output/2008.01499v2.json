  "abstractText": "Distributed linguistic representations are powerful tools for modelling the uncertainty and complexity of preference information in linguistic decision making. To provide a comprehensive perspective on the development of distributed linguistic representations in decision making, we present the taxonomy of existing distributed linguistic representations. Then, we review the key elements and applications of distributed linguistic information processing in decision making, including the distance measurement, aggregation methods, distributed linguistic preference relations, and distributed linguistic multiple attribute decision making models. Next, we provide a discussion on ongoing challenges and future research directions from the perspective of data science and explainable artificial intelligence.",

The classical CW models emphasize on handling linguistic information based on the use of membership functions [101]-[104].\nIn CW, a mainstream is the linguistic symbolic computational models [14], [94]-[96], among which the 2-tuple linguistic representation model [31] is widely used to handle balanced linguistic information in the form of linguistic 2-tuples.

Herrera).\nmethods are proposed to process unbalanced linguistic information, including the proportional 2-tuple linguistic model [82], unbalanced linguistic term set [30], numerical scale [18], and nonuniform ordered qualitative scale [23]. Considering individuality of decision makers in expressing and understanding words, personalized individual semantics (PIS) based models [16], [38]-[41] are introduced following the stream of linguistic symbolic computational models. Another mainstream are the type-2 fuzzy sets, because words mean different things to different people [60], the type-2 fuzzy sets are used to deal with this issue [56]-[59].\nIn the last decade has been proposed two different concepts for representing cognitive complex information, in 2012 the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) [70] and in 2014 the linguistic distribution (LD) [107], becoming two approaches in modelling hesitant and uncertain linguistic information in decision making. (i) HFLTSs are well qualified to represent decision makers\u2019 hesitant preferences by using comparative linguistic expressions. (ii) LDs provide certain symbolic proportion information over linguistic terms to describe distributed preferences of decision makers as distributed assessments. In [66], Pang et al. introduced the probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS), with a different name for the similar concept, and the use of LD.\nCompared with simple linguistic 2-tuples, complex expressions like HFLTS and LD have improved the flexibility of expression and have shown to be very useful to deal with complex decision making problems. In practical decision contexts with complexity, decision makers are often uncertain and hesitant to make decisions due to tight time pressure and lack of knowledge, and their linguistic preference information may be presented in the form of distributed linguistic representations [17], [107]. These phenomena have raised the rapidly growing demand of modelling and processing distributed preferences with efficiency, and advanced distributed linguistic representations to become increasingly popular in decision making.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a review of the current hot topics of distributed linguistic representations in decision making, including the taxonomy of distributed linguistic representations, the key elements in distributed linguistic decision making, and some challenges and future research directions from the perspective of data science and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the origin, basic concepts and taxonomy of existing distributed linguistic representations. Then Section 3 presents the key elements and applications of distributed linguistic representations in decision making. Next, the challenges and future research directions are discussed in Section 4. Finally, the main conclusions are drawn in Section 5."

      "heading": "2.1 Origin of distributed linguistic representation: linguistic 2-tuples and HFLTS",
      "text": "In the development of linguistic decision making, various distributed linguistic representations have been proposed to model decision makers\u2019 linguistic preferences. These distributed linguistic representations are basically derived from the following two types of basic linguistic expression formats:\n(1) Linguistic 2-tuples, which show their convenience in preferences construction\nvia single or two successive linguistic terms;\n(2) HFLTS, which is well qualified to elicit hesitant preferences by using several\nconsecutive linguistic terms.\nThis section reviews the basic concepts of linguistic 2-tuples and HFLTS. Definition 1 (2-tuple linguistic representation model) [31], [55]: Let\n 0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established linguistic term set with odd cardinality satisfying the\nrequired characteristics: (i) The set is ordered: i jl l if i j ; (ii) A negation operator:\n( )i jNeg l l= such that j g i= \u2212 , and g+1 is the cardinality of L. Let [0, ]g  be a\nnumerical value representing the result of a symbolic aggregation operation. Then, a linguistic 2-tuple ( ),il  , where il L and [ 0.5,0.5)  \u2212 that expresses the equivalent information to  is obtained by means of a one to one mapping:\n:[0, ] [ 0.5,0.5)g L \u2192  \u2212 , and\n( ) ( , )il  = (1)\nwith  , ( ), [ 0.5,0.5)il i roundi   == \u2212  \u2212 where round is the usual round operation. Let  ( , ) | , [ 0.5,0.5)i iL l l L =   \u2212 be the set of all the linguistic 2-tuples associated to L. The inverse function of  is denoted by: -1 : [0, ]L g \u2192 with\n( )-1 ,il i  = + . If 0 = , the linguistic 2-tuple ( ),il  is a simple term il . And the negation operator of a linguistic 2-tuple ( ),il  is defined by\n( )( )1( , ) ( , )i iNeg l g l \u2212=  \u2212  .\nLinguistic 2-tuple and its computational model [31] have shown good advantages in constructing simple linguistic preferences of decision makers in linguistic decision making. An overview on the 2-tuple linguistic representation model for CW in decision making can be found in [55].\nWang and Hao [82] proposed the proportional linguistic 2-tuples, which add\nsymbolic proportion information to two successive linguistic terms.\nDefinition 2 (Proportional 2-tuple linguistic representation model) [82]: Let\n 0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established linguistic term set, [0,1]I = and {( ,iIL I L   =\n) | [0,1], }i i il l L   . Given a pair 1( , )i il l + of two successive terms of L, any two elements ( , )i il and 1 1( , )i il + + of IL are called a symbolic proportion pair, and 1( , )i i  + are called a pair of symbolic proportions of the pair 1( , )i il l + if 1 1i i  ++ = .\nA symbolic proportion pair ( , )i il 1(1 , )i il +\u2212 can be denoted as ( )1,(1 )i i i il l  +\u2212 ,\nand the proportional 2-tuple set generated by L is denoted by\n( ) 1,(1 ) | [0,1], }i i i i i iL l l l L  += \u2212   . (2)\nThe elements of L are called linguistic proportional 2-tuples. The negation operator for proportional linguistic 2-tuples is defined by\n( )( ) ( )1 1,(1 ) (1 ) ,i i i i i g i i g iNeg l l l l   + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212 = \u2212 .\nTo improve the flexibility of linguistic expressions, HFLTS [70] was proposed, which acts as a tool in fulfilling decision makers\u2019 hesitant necessities and requirements by applying comparative linguistic expressions (several consecutive linguistic terms). The concept of HFLTS is introduced as Definition 3.\nDefinition 3 (HFLTS) [70]: Let  0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established linguistic term\nset. An HFLTS, Lh , is an ordered finite subset of consecutive linguistic terms of L. The expression of Lh is given by\n 1, ,..., | 0L i i jh l l l i j g+=    . (3)\nThe negation operation for Lh is defined by  ( ) | , {0,1,..., }L g i i LNeg h l l h i g\u2212=   .\nAn approach to generate HFLTS based preferences via comparative linguistic expressions by using a context-free grammar was presented in [70]. The recent developments for HFLTS in decision making can refer to [69].\nThe distributed linguistic representations in this review have two origins: (1) Extension of the proportional linguistic 2-tuple based representation, referring\nto Zhang et al. [107], Guo et al. [25], [26];\n(2) HFLTS with distributed preference information, referring to Wu and Xu [90],\nChen et al. [9], Pang et al. [66], Zhang et al. [109], etc.\nIn particular, distributed linguistic representations can be formed in two ways: linguistic preference expressions with distributed information in an individual context ([17], [107], etc.), and information fusion of linguistic terms or HFLTSs in a group context ([46], [100], [118], [119], etc.), which can be described in Fig. 1.\nDistributed information over\nlinguistic terms or HFLTSs in\nindividual contexts\nLinguistic terms,\nHFLTS\nDistributed linguistic\nrepresentations\nInformation fusion of linguistic terms or HFLTSs in group contexts\nFig.1 Formation of distributed linguistic representations in decision making\nThe distributed linguistic representations are reviewed in the following sections\nin detail."

[26] discussed the LD with partial symbolic information by introducing the concept of PLD through a different mathematical representation.\nDefinition 5 (PLD) [26]: Let  0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established ordinal linguistic\nterm set, and [0,1]I = , {( , ) | [0,1], }i i i iIL I L l l L   =   be the set of\nproportional 2-tuples of L. Given a sequence of r+1 successive ordinal terms of L, any r+1 elements ( , )i il , 1 1( , )i il + + ,\u2026, ( , )i r i rl + + of IL are called a symbolic proportion sequence.

If 1 i r\njj i \n+\n= = ,\np LD is called a complete PLD; if 1 i r jj i  + =  , pLD is called an incomplete PLD.\nThe set of all the symbolic proportion sequences is called proportional linguistic\ndistribution set, denoted by *L : ( ) * 1 1, ,..., , | 0 , ,i i i i i r i r iL l l l i i r g l L   + + + +=  +   .\nIn [25], Guo et al. discussed the PLD with interval symbolic proportions. (2) PLTS Pang et al. [66] proposed the PLTS to solve decision makers\u2019 preferences with hesitancy among several possible linguistic terms. Moreover, the incomplete probabilistic distribution information of certain linguistic terms is considered.\nDefinition 6 (PLTS) [66]: Let  0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established ordinal linguistic\nterm set. A PLTS is defined by\n ( ) ( ) | , 0, 1,..., ( ( )i i i iL p l p l L p i n L p=   = (6)\nwhere ( ( ))\n0 1\nn L p ii p =  , and ( ( ))n L p denotes the number of element il in L(p).\nIn a PLTS ( )L p , il represents decision maker\u2019s preference and ip is the\nprobability of il . If ( ( )) 0 1 n L p ii p = = , the probability distribution information of ( )L p is complete; if ( ( ))\n0 1\nn L p ii p =  , partial ignorance exists because of decision makers\u2019\nknowledge limitation.\nA computational model for handling incompleteness of L(p) is presented in [66]. Remark 1. A PLTS is transformed into an LD by using the normalization method proposed in [66]. However, such transformation is questionable [40], which can be\ndemonstrated by using the following example. Let  0 1 2 3 4, , , ,L l l l l l= be a linguistic\nterm set and  3 4( ) (0.3), (0.3)L p l l= be a PLTS. By using the normalization method\nproposed in [66], an LD  3 4( ,0.5),( ,0.5)LD l l= can be obtained. Obviously,\n 3 4( ) (0.3), (0.3)L p l l= and  3 4( ,0.5),( ,0.5)LD l l= represent different preference\ninformation. In fact, for two PLTSs ( ) {( ( ) | , 0, 1,2..., ( ( ))}r r r r r ri i i iL p l p l L p i n L p=   = and ( ) {( ( ) | , 0, 1,2..., ( ( ))}s s s s s si i i iL p l p l L p i n L p=   = , if ( ( )) ( ( )) r sn L p n L p= , r si il l= , and\nr r i ip p= ( 1,2,..., ( ( ))) ri n L p= , then ( )rL p and ( )sL p will be transformed into the\nsame LD by using the normalization method proposed in [66], which is unreasonable.\n(3) ILD Zhang et al. [105] proposed the ILD, as shown in Definition 7.\nDefinition 7 (ILD) [85], [105]: Let  0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established ordinal\nlinguistic term set. An ILD of L is given by\n( ) , ( ) , | 0,1,...,IL i iD l l i g = = (7)\nwhere il L , 0 ( ) 1 g ii l  = + = , and ( ), [0,1]il   .\nAn ILD can be used to express a decision maker\u2019s preferences with incompleteness.\nIn an ILD ILD , il represents the linguistic term used by decision makers, and ( )il represents the relevant symbolic proportion information of il . The variable  represents the extent of incompleteness and uncertainty in the preference ILD . If 0 = , I\nLD is complete and equivalent to the LD in Definition 4. Otherwise, the larger\n indicates the greater uncertainty in ILD ."

If ( ) ( ) L U i il l = , ~ LD is mathematically consistent with the LD in Definition 4.\nWu and Xu [90] proposed the PDHFLTS in group decision making (GDM) context, in which decision makers provide their preferences via single terms and possibility information is distributed over terms in an HFLTS.\nDefinition 10 (PDHFLTS) [90]: Let  0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established linguistic\nterm set, and Lh be an HFLTS of L given by a decision maker. The PDHFLTS is represented by\n( ) , | L\nP\nh i i i LD l p l h=  (10)\nwhere ( )0 1, ,..., gP p p p= is the possibility distribution of Lh , 1/ ( )0 L i Li n h l h p otherwise  =\ndenotes the possibility assigned over the linguistic term il , 0 1 g ii p = = , and ( )Ln h is the number of elements in Lh .\nIn a PDHFLTS L\nP\nhD , preference from a decision maker is represented by an HFLTS,\nand each term il in this HFLTS has the same possibility ip to become the assessment value of an alternative.\nChen et al. [9] proposed the PHFLTS to solve HFLTS based preferences provided\nby decision makers in GDM problems.\nDefinition 11 (PHFLTS) [9]: Let  0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established linguistic term\nset, and kLh ( 1,..., )k n= be n HFLTSs given by n decision makers. A PHFLTS based on the union of kLh is a set of ordered finite proportional pairs, represented by\n ( , ) | LH i i i P l p l L=  (11)\nwhere ( , )i il p is called a proportional linguistic pair, 0 1( , ,..., )gP p p p = is a\nproportional vector and [0,1]ip  represents the possibility degree of il provided by\nn decision makers, and 0\n1 g\nii p = = .\nChen et al. [9] discussed the case of PHFLTS with incomplete proportion information, and mentioned that PHFLTS is mathematically consistent with LD in Definition 4. Some associated computational approaches can be found in [10]-[12].\nZhang et al. [109] proposed the HLD, in which preferences of decision makers are\nHFLTSs.\nDefinition 12 (HLD) [109]: Let  0 1, ,..., gL l l l= be an established linguistic term\nset, and Lh be an HFLTS of L given by a decision maker. Let the set of all the HFLTS of L be LH . The HLD is defined by\n ( , ( )) | LH L L L L D h h h H=  (12)\nwhere ( ) [0,1] { }Lh null   and ( )Lh is the symbolic proportion of Lh if\n( ) { }Lh null  .\nIn an HLD LH D , preference from a decision maker is a set of HFLTSs Lh with certain possibility ( )Lh , and the element Lh is not used if ( ) { }Lh null = . If\n( ) 1 L L Lh H h  = , LH D is complete; if ( ) 1 L L Lh H h   , LH D is with incompleteness.\nZhang et al. [109] proposed a normalization method for the case of ( ) 1 L L Lh H h   ."

      "text": "The distributed linguistic representations have been utilized in MADM to model the uncertain assessments of decision makers, and several distributed linguistic MADM approaches are developed accordingly, which are summarized in Table 4.\nThe LD has been applied in MADM to represent uncertain assessments of decision makers. Yao [97] proposed a consensus reaching model for multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) with assessments represented by means of LDs, in which a feedback mechanism is devised by combining an identification rule and an optimization-based model. Wu et al. [84] presented a minimum adjustment cost feedback mechanism based consensus model for MAGDM under social network, in which the assessments information and the trust relationships among decision makers\nare both represented by LDs. Based on the use of LDs and HFLTSs, Wu et al. [88] proposed the MSDM to address linguistic MAGDM problem, which aims at maximizing the support degree of group opinion as well as guarantying the accuracy of group opinion. Zhang et al. [119] designed an approach to manage multi-granular LDs in large-scale MAGDM, in which a linguistic computational model is developed based on the extended linguistic hierarchies model and the transformation formulas between a linguistic 2-tuple and an LD. Recently, Zhang et al. [120] developed a large-scale MAGDM model with multi-granular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. In their model, all unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic information is transformed into LDs defined on a balanced linguistic term set. Yu et al. [99] proposed a method to deal with large-scale GDM problems with multi-granular unbalanced linguistic information, in which the initial multi-granular unbalanced linguistic information of decision makers is represented by unbalanced LDs and the classical TODIM method is extended to derive a raking of alternatives. Liang et al. [46] developed a consensus-based analysis model for MAGDM with multi-granular LD preferences.\nDong et al. [17] proposed an MAGDM with INLD under multi-granular unbalanced linguistic contexts. First, a basic linguistic term set is selected to normalize the individual unbalanced INLDs matrices. Then, the collective unbalanced INLDs matrix is obtained by aggregating the normalized individual unbalanced INLDs matrices. Following this, the ranking of alternatives is obtained from the collective unbalanced INLDs matrix.\n(2) MADM approaches with PLD, PLTS, and ILD In real-world MADM, due to the limitation of knowledge, problem complexity and time pressure, the assessment information given by decision makers may not be complete. Various distributed linguistic MADM methods to handle incomplete assessment information have been proposed.\nGuo et al. [26] proposed a PLD based model for MADM under linguistic uncertainty, which is based on the nature of symbolic linguistic model combined with distributed assessments. Moreover, this model is also able to deal with ILDs so that it allows evaluators to avoid the dilemma of having to supply complete assessments when not available.\nHan et al. [28] proposed a new computational model based on Archimedean copula for unbalanced PLTS and developed an MAGDM based on it. Liu et al. [51] presented the bidirectional projection method for probabilistic linguistic MAGDM based on power average operator. Liu and Li [50] developed an extended MULTIMOORA method for probabilistic linguistic MAGDM based on prospect theory. Pang et al. [66] developed an extended TOPSIS method and an aggregation-based method respectively for MAGDM with probabilistic linguistic information. Tian et al. [77]\npresented a probabilistic linguistic MADM based on evidential reasoning and combined ranking methods considering decision-makers\u2019 psychological preferences. Wang et al. [83] proposed a distance-based MAGDM approach with PLTSs. Wang [81] proposed a generalized distance measurements method between two PLTs with multi-granular linguistic information, and applied them to deal with multi-granular MAGDM problems. Zhou et al. [123] proposed particle swarm optimization method for trust relationship based social network MAGDM under a probabilistic linguistic environment.\nZhang et al. [105] developed a consensus-oriented aggregation model for MAGDM with ILDs, which can obtain a collective opinion with maximum consensus, and further developed a minimum-cost consensus model with variable unit consensus cost. Zhang et al. [113] developed a deviation minimum-based optimization model to manage ILDs in MAGDM by minimizing the opinion deviation among decision makers, and proposed a consensus-reaching model with bounded confidences based feedback adjustment mechanism to assist decision makers to gain a consensus.\n(3) MADM approaches with PDHFLTS, PHFLTSs, HLD, and FLE HFLTS based distributed linguistic MADM approaches have been proposed and\nutilized to tackle a variety of decision problems.\nWu and Xu [90] proposed operation laws and aggregation operators and for PDHFLTS and built a framework to deal with both consensus and selection processes for MAGDM problems with PDHFLTSs. Wu et al. [91] examined an MAGDM problem in which the linguistic information was represented by PDHFLTS, and developed two approaches based on VIKOR and TOPSIS to find a compromise solution.\nChen et al. [9] developed a proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic MAGDM model, in which a probability theory-based outranking method for PHFLTSs was proposed and two fundamental aggregation operators for PHFLTSs were provided.\nZhang et al. [109] proposed an approach for MAGDM with HLD, in which the transformation between HLDs and LDs and the basic comparison and aggregation operations to perform on HLDs are developed.\nWu et al. [86] proposed MAGDM with FLE. In the proposed model, an FLE aggregation process with accurate constraints is developed to improve the quality (i.e., accuracy) of the collective result as well as guarantee the principle of minimum preference-loss through a mixed 0-1 linear programming model. Meanwhile, the consensus rules with minimum preference-loss are designed to support the consensus reaching process in the MAGDM with FLE."

      "heading": "3.5. Some real-life applications",
      "text": "In this section, some real-life applications of the distributed linguistic\nrepresentations are introduced. In Table 5, we provide a summary of them.\nAs a proactive risk management instrument, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) has been broadly utilized to recognize, evaluate, and eliminate failure modes of products, processes, systems and services [24]. Due to various subjective and objective conditions, it is often difficult for FMEA team members to provide precise values for the assessment of failure modes. Instead, they prefer to utilize linguistic labels to state their opinions regarding the risk of failure modes. Recently, the distributed linguistic representations have been adopted to model the uncertain opinions of FMEA team members. For example, Huang et al. [32] applied LDs to represent FMEA team members\u2019 risk evaluation information and employed an improved TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision making) method to determine the risk priority of failure modes. Ju et al. [34] proposed new approaches for heterogeneous linguistic FMEA with incomplete weight information as well as the idea to convert heterogeneous linguistic information to LDs.\nNie et al. [64] developed a hybrid risk evaluation model within the FMEA framework based on the use of multi-granular LDs and applied this model to supercritical water gasification system. Zhang et al. [110] proposed a consensus-based MAGDM approach for ordinal classification-based FMEA problem, in which FMEA participants provide their preferences in a linguistic way using LDs. Zhang et al. [113] integrated a consensus-reaching mechanism with bounded confidences into the FMEA framework and adopts ILDs to represent risk assessment information. Zhang et al. [111] presented the design of a PIS-based FMEA approach, in which members express their opinions over failure modes and risk factors using LDs.\n(2) Applications in hotel selection With the considerable development of tourism market, as well as the expansion of the e-commerce platform scale, increasing tourists often prefer to select tourism products such as services or hotels online. Thus, it is necessary to develop efficient decision support models for tourists to select tourism products. Liang et al. [43] developed decision support model for hotel selection based on sentiment analysis and LD-VIKOR method, where the text data are transformed into LDs via sentiment analysis. Nie et al. [62] proposed a scientific hotel selection model to assist tourists in choosing a satisfactory hotel and guiding hoteliers to gain competitive advantages in the e-tourism era, in which LDs are used to summarize and denote evaluation values under certain criteria associated with hotels. Peng et al. [67] developed an applicable hotel decision support model for tourists utilizing online reviews on TripAdvisor.com, in which PLTSs are introduced to summarize this information statistically by considering a great deal of review information associated with hotels posted by numerous tourists on TripAdvisor.com. Yu et al. [98] designed a mathematical model to select appropriate hotels on websites based on LDs. Zhang et al. [106] proposed a multi-stage MADM method based on online reviews for hotel selection considering the aspirations with different development speeds, in which LDs are used to deal with online reviews.\n(3) Applications in sustainability evaluation and other selection problems Water security sustainability plays an increasingly crucial role in maintaining the balance between industrialization, urbanization and sustainability. Nie et al. [63] established an observation data conversion standard and adopted LDs as information representation and developed a multistage decision support framework by combining several MADM techniques (such as, best-worst method, DEMATEL, and TOPSIS) for water security sustainability evaluation. With the accumulation of practical experience and the maturity of technology, constructed wetlands have gradually become multi-functional ecological systems. Luo et al. [52] proposed GDM approach for evaluating the sustainability of constructed wetlands with PLPRs.\nThe sustainable third-party reverse logistics provider selection, as the core of\nsustainable supply chain management, has become paramount in research nowadays. Luo and Li [53] utilized PDHFLTSs to deal with the situation in which decision makers may hesitate in a few linguistic terms and have different partiality towards each term in the actual evaluation process, and presented an MAGDM method by combining PDHFLTSs and MULTIMOORA for the sustainable third-party reverse logistics provider selection in the e-commerce express industry.\n\u201cNo technology, no finance\u2019\u2019 has been the consensus in banking industry. Under the background of financial technology (Fintech), how to select an appropriate technology company to cooperate for the banks has become a key. Miao et al. [54] developed an MAGDM model with PLTSs for financial technologies selection. Krishankumar et al. [37] proposed a GDM framework for renewable energy source selection under interval-valued PLTSs.\nCloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a combination of standard ERP system and cloud flexibility. On the basis of extended probabilistic linguistic MULTIMOORA method and Choquet integral operator, Chen et al. [7] introduced an innovative two-step comparative method for the evaluation of cloud-based ERP systems. Ju et al. [33] presented a framework incorporating the evaluation based on distance from average solution method for selecting desirable health-care waste disposal alternative(s), in which multi-granular LDs are adopted by decision makers to assess the ratings of alternatives and subjective weights of criteria.\n(4) Applications in emergency decision making and prioritization events According to the characteristics of emergency management, Gao et al. [22] proposed an emergency decision support method by using the PLPR, and a case study about the emergency decision making in a petrochemical plant fire accident is conducted to illustrate the proposed method. Li and Wei [42] proposed an emergency decision-making method based on D-S evidence theory and PLTSs, and applied the proposed method to an actual mine accident.\nWith the tremendous growth of cloud vendors, cloud vendor prioritization is a complex decision-making problem. Sivagami et al. [72] proposed a scientific decision framework for Cloud Vendor prioritization under PLTSs context with unknown/partial weight information. Tian et al. [78] presented an improved quality function deployment for prioritizing service designs, in which multi-granular unbalanced linguistic term sets are used to capture evaluators' ratings to cope with vague information. Moreover, a unification method is proposed to convert multi-granular linguistic information into LDs."

      "heading": "4.1. Summary and critical discussion: A decision making perspective",
      "text": "The review about distributed linguistic representations is mainly summarized from\na triple perspective:\n(1) Origin of distributed linguistic representations. The distributed linguistic representations in the literature are mainly derived from: (i) extension of proportional linguistic 2-tuple representation, including LD, INLD, PLD, and ILD; and (ii) extending HFLTSs preferences, including PDHFLTS, PHFLTS, PLTS, HLD, and FLE. Particularly, these distributed linguistic representations can be formed in two ways: (i) distributed linguistic preference expressions in an individual context; and (ii) information fusion of linguistic terms or HFLTSs in a group context.\n(2) Taxonomy of LD and its variants. We present the taxonomy of distributed linguistic representations. The LD is the first attempt to model the distributed linguistic representations among the decision-making community, and the follow-up notions and concepts are mathematically consistent with LD in some sense: FLE is the generalization of all the distributed linguistic representations reviewed; LD, PDHFLTS, PHFLTS, PLTS, PLD, and ILD are special HLDs; PLTS and ILD are mathematically consistent with PLD; PHFLTS is mathematically consistent with LD; PDHFLTS is the special case of LD; and INLD is a generalization of LD.\n(3) Applications in decision making. We review different applications of distributed linguistic representations in decision making from four aspects. (i) Distributed linguistic distance measurements and aggregation methods. Most of them are based on classical distance measurements and aggregation operators. Moreover, optimization methods are also developed for dealing with accuracy problems in some decision contexts. (ii) Distributed linguistic pairwise comparison methods, including three types of distributed linguistic preference relations (i.e., DLPR, PLPR, and FLPR). (iii) Distributed linguistic MADM approaches. Several researchers revisited this issue based on classical MADM methods in distributed linguistic contexts. (iv) Real-life applications, in which participants involved prefer to adopt distributed linguistic representations to express their preferences to deal with practical decision problems.\nDistributed linguistic representations have been widely studied to model the uncertainty and complexity of preference information in decision making, but there still exist some limitations to be further highlighted:\n(1) Although distributed linguistic representations have been analyzed from multiple aspects, it still lacks a systematic research on the transformations among them. Relevant discussions on transformations from an axiom-based perspective are of significant necessity, and rational minimum information-loss based transformation\nmodels are needed to be designed as well. Notably, normalization methods have been proposed to transform PLTSs with incompleteness to LDs, but they are questionable. Thus, reasonable normalization methods from PLTSs to LDs are worth studying.\n(2) In distributed linguistic representations many similar concepts have been put forward, and there is much parallel research in decision-making being undertaken, which lead to lots of repeated discussions and confusion of concepts. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the original one and undertake valuable research and comparisons. Particularly, the FLE will be a potential tool in distributed linguistic representations to form a unified framework."

      "heading": "4.2. Challenges in data science and artificial intelligence: An explainable",
      "text": "linguistic approach\nThe development of data science and artificial intelligence, particularly the efforts currently being made in the area of XAI [4], has provided enormous opportunities as well as arising challenges. How to fix the idea of XAI, and the opportunity to use linguistic information for representing the cognitive complex expressions from decision makers/experts or data driven approaches getting linguistic labels as knowledge, is needed to be addressed.\n(1) Natural language processing (NLP) method. NLP is a significant artificial intelligence-based tool to process information linguistically. The potential in using NLP approaches in decision making has been partially shown in the literature [124], and the research on opinion mining from user data is being undertaken, such as accurate recognition of specific behaviors [5], credit risk assessments [61], etc. The advent of data science has brought the chance that NLP-based techniques can be used to handle a wider range of linguistic data [27], [36]. Particular attention should be paid to the data driven decision making using distributed linguistic representations as a representation approach for getting the information, experts\u2019 assessments from the data, and using NLP approaches for getting linguistic assessments from linguistic opinions. Essentially, challenges under this perspective rely on how to apply these NLP-based techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis) as well as data-driven technologies to analyze decision makers\u2019 distributed linguistic data, and emphasize on the necessity to figure out the characteristics of complexity of distributed linguistic information, and the difficulty to effectively handle these complexity with data-driven NLP tools.\n(2) Data fusion with data-driven and/or artificial intelligent approaches. In the extent reviewed literature about the fusion methods of distributed linguistic information in decision making problems, the popular methods are based on the aggregation operators and mathematical optimization modelling. The development of mass media and internet technologies has witnessed more and more direct or indirect participation from different groups in the process of decision making. Complex\ndistributed linguistic preferences are provided by decision makers with varying social backgrounds, self-confidence levels, knowledge structures, etc., and some key elements begin to appear in the decision making at a large scale [15], such as interactions with behaviors among decision makers/experts [6], [65], [93].\nThe challenges in this perspective centralize on coping with enormous amounts of distributed linguistic information from disparate data sources with data-driven and/or intelligent approaches. The analysis or processing of such information is no longer using traditional decision support tools or simple aggregation techniques. In contrast to the black models provided by the neural network based approaches, whose utility in data analysis have been limited because of the interpretation difficulty, linguistic based models with explainability are much more suitable. How to fuse these data and how to acquire significant insights from these data are still the future research needed to be investigated.\n(3) Data-driven preference learning methods. Preference learning is a new research field of the intersection of machine learning and decision making. The preference learning mainly focuses on the analysis of individual and group characteristics, and modelling group/multi-attribute preference learning functions by learning historical data [2], [13]. It is worth pointing out that the advent of data science and artificial intelligence highlights the importance of preference learning methodology driven by large scale data sets [68]. The potential of applying data-driven preference learning methods in linguistic decision making is still under development. For example, how to learn the word encoding (semantic analysis), which is the core of CW, and model PIS-based semantic learning from distributed linguistic data at a large scale, is a problem worthy of further study.\nRecent studies [1], [108] suggested that deep learning approaches are playing vital roles in parameter estimating and parameter settings for correlated features of decision models. Thereby, this learning method could be used to estimate optimal weights of multiple attributes in distributed linguistic MADM, and to determine suitable parameter settings for aggregation functions in the fusion process of distributed linguistic data. The potential of these machine learning methods can be detected in various practical applications, such as financial risk analysis [35], online social recommendation [122], etc.\n(4) Social network analysis (SNA) applications. With the development of social media and communication technologies, it is easier to obtain the access to information about social networks, which makes interactions among decision makers become increasingly common. As a powerful tool, SNA has been investigated to support the decision process from many aspects such as opinion dynamics [20], trust/distrust relationships [79], [117], GDM [19], and LSDM [15], in which relationships among decision makers are modelled in a social network. Combining the distributed\ntrust/distrust relationships among decision makers analyzed by SNA, the preference characteristics of decision makers are identified, which can further support the management of decision makers\u2019 behaviors and the approaches for generating recommendations to improve the efficiency of decision process. It would also be interesting to apply these SNA-based decision models into real-life decision problems. For example, in the hotel selection driven by online textual reviews [62], customers\u2019 sentiments can be analyzed to extract both preferences and distributed trust relationship information as an input for decision models.\n(5) Online customer reviews application. Mass media and platforms have been vested with significant power in society. For example, it is noted that the spread of e-commerce platforms and mobile apps have improved customers\u2019 ability to assess products online. Online reviews on various e-commerce platforms have become an important part of the electronic word of mouth and the important references for potential customers to make decisions [48]. These online reviews/data have significant distribution characteristics and effective analysis or processing of these data can help enterprises/government understand the consumer preference much better, and make rational decision accordingly.\nIn future research, a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of consumption data sources is needed. In particular, NLP-based, emotion recognition-based [121], SNA-based, and PIS-based approaches [45] are powerful tools to better and accurately understand the sociality and individuality of customers through these distributed linguistic data."
