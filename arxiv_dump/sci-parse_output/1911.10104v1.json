  "abstractText": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of domains such as security, finance, healthcare, medicine, and criminal justice. Explaining the decisions of AI systems in human terms is a key challenge\u2014due to the high complexity of the model, as well as the potential implications on human interests, rights, and lives . While Explainable AI is an emerging field of research, there is no consensus on the definition, quantification, and formalization of explainability. In fact, the quantification of explainability is an open challenge. In our previous work, we incorporated domain knowledge for better explainability, however, we were unable to quantify the extent of explainability. In this work, we (1) briefly analyze the definitions of explainability from the perspective of different disciplines (e.g., psychology, social science), properties of explanation, explanation methods, and human-friendly explanations; and (2) propose and formulate an approach to quantify the extent of explainability. Our experimental result suggests a reasonable and model-agnostic way to quantify explainability.",

      "text": "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has spread into a spectrum of high-stakes applications from different domains such as security, finance, healthcare, medicine, and criminal justice, impacting human interests, rights, and lives. Following the pace of the demand, the successful AI-based models have also become so complex that their decisions have become too complicated to express in human terms. This further complicates their adoption in many sensitive disciplines, raising concerns from the ethical, privacy, fairness, and transparency perspectives. The root cause of the problem is the lack of explainability and/or interpretability of the decision.\nWe have seen the very confusing use of the terms \u2019explainability\u2019 and \u2019interpretability\u2019 throughout the literature. Some treat these as the same and stick to one, while some differentiate among the two, and others use them ambiguously. Research in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is seeing a resurgence after three decades of slowed progress since some preliminary work on expert systems in the early\nCopyright c\u00a9 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\n1980\u2019s. Currently, there is no consensus on the definition these terms. In addition, the quantification of explainability is another open challenge, which will be difficult until there is a consensus on the concrete definition of those terms (e.g., explainability, interpretability).\nIn our previous work (Islam et al. 2019), we proposed an approach to incorporate domain knowledge in the model to make the prediction more explainable. However, we were unable to quantify the quality of explanations (i.e., validation of explainability). There has been some previous work (Molnar, Casalicchio, and Bischl 2019) that mentions three notions for quantificiaiton of explainability. The first two notions involve experimental studies with humans that mainly investigate whether a human can predict the outcome of the model (Dhurandhar et al. 2017), (Friedler et al. 2019), (Huysmans et al. 2011), (Poursabzi-Sangdeh et al. 2018), (Zhou et al. 2018). However, the third notion (proxy tasks) does not involve a human. Instead they use known truth as a metric (e.g., the less the depth of the decision tree, the more explainable the model).\nIn this work, our contributions are as follows: 1. We define explainability and interpretability from a multi-\ndomain perspective and clarify their resemblance (Section 2).\n2. We analyze the properties of explanation (Section 4.2), explanation methods (Section 4.1), and human friendly explanations (Section 4.3).\n3. We present a potential way to formalize and quantify explainability with experimental results (Section 5 and 6).\n2 Explainability, and Interpretabiliy (Miller 2018) argue that most of the work on XAI focuses on the researcher\u2019s intuition of what constitutes a good explanation. However, there exists a vast area of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science on how people generate, select, evaluate, and represent explanations and associated cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. Therefore, the author emphasizes that the research on Explainable AI should incorporate studies from these different domains.\nFrom the social science perspective, according to (Miller 2018) and (Lombrozo 2006), explanation is both a process and product:\nar X\niv :1\n91 1.\n10 10\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 2\nN ov\n2 01\n9\n\u2022 Cognitive explanation process: identifies the causes for an event, perhaps concerning particular counterfactual cases, and a subset of these causes is selected as the explanation.\n\u2022 Product: the explanation that results from the cognitive explanation process.\n\u2022 Social process: the process of transferring knowledge between explainer and explainee, generally an interaction between groups of people, in which the goal is to provide the explainee with enough information to understand the causes of the event.\nThis definition of explanation insists that it is both a process and product (i.e., outcome), and focuses on understanding the causes of the event.\nFurthermore, according to psychologist (Lombrozo 2006), \u201dExplanations are the currency in which we exchanged belief\u201d. This definition stresses the need for high fidelity for the explanation, in other words, gaining trust from the explanation recipient. Moreover, according to physicist (Deutsch 1998) who is the pioneer of quantum computation: explanations consist of interpretations of how the world works and why. This definition suggests that explanations are roughly equal to or a superset of interpretations. Interpretations are the building blocks of explanations; without interpretation, explanation is incomplete. Furthermore, the terms \u201dexplainability\u201d and \u201dinterpretability\u201d are simply the extent of explanation and interpretation accordingly.\nThere are other mentionable definitions too. According to Miller (2017) (Miller 2018), \u201dinterpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision\u201d. Besides, according to Kim (Kim et al. 2017) \u201dInterpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the model\u2019s result\u201d. Furthermore, according to (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016) \u201dBy \u2019explaining a prediction\u2019, we mean presenting textual or visual artifacts that provide qualitative understanding of the relationship between the instance\u2019s components (e.g. words in text, patches in an image) and the model\u2019s prediction\u201d. In other words, (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016) put an emphasis on the qualitative understanding of the relationship between input and output (i.e., a selective/suitable set of information pieces that together can refer to a cause to an event, in contrast to the complete causal attributions) .\nTo this end, in the case of an intelligent system (i.e., AI/ML-based system), it is evident that explainability is more than interpretability in terms of importance, completeness, and fidelity of prediction. Based on that, we choose to keep our focus entirely on explainability instead of interpretability. Finally, analyzing different definitions from the literature, we come up with following:\nDefinition: Explainability of an AI model\u2019s prediction is the extent of transferable qualitative understanding of the relationship between model input and prediction (i.e., selective/suitable causes of the event) in a recipient friendly manner.\nWe proceed further based on this informal definition of explainability.\n3 Background There are two primary directions of research towards evaluation of explainability of an AI/ML model: (1) model complexity-based and (2) human study based."

      "text": "In the literature, model complexity and (lack of) model interpretability are often treated as the same (Molnar, Casalicchio, and Bischl 2019). For instance, in (Fu\u0308rnkranz, Gamberger, and Lavrac\u030c 2012), (Yang, Rudin, and Seltzer 2017), model size is often used as a measure of interpretability (e.g., number of decision rules, depth of tree, number of non-zero coefficients).\n(Yang, Rudin, and Seltzer 2017) propose a scalable Bayesian Rule List (i.e., probabilistic rule list) consisting of a sequence of IF-THEN rules, identical to a decision list or one-sided decision tree. Unlike the decision tree that uses greedy splitting and pruning, their approach produces a highly sparse and accurate rule list with a balance between interpretability, accuracy, and computation speed. Similarly, the work of (Fu\u0308rnkranz, Gamberger, and Lavrac\u030c 2012) is also rule-based. They attempt to evaluate the quality of the rules from a rule learning algorithm by: the observed coverage, which is the number of positive examples covered by the rule, which should be maximized to explain the training data well; and consistency, which is the number of negative examples covered by the rule, which should be minimized to generalize well to unseen data.\nFurthermore, according to (Ru\u0308ping and others 2006), while the number of features and the size of the decision tree are directly related to the interpretability, the optimization of the tree size or features (i.e., feature selection) is costly as it requires generation of a large set of models and their elimination in subsequent steps. Besides, reducing the tree size (i.e., reducing complexity) increases error; however, they could not find a way to formulate the relation in simple functional form.\nMore recently, (Molnar, Casalicchio, and Bischl 2019) attempt to quantify the complexity of the arbitrary machine learning model with a model agnostic measure. In that work, the author demonstrates that when the feature interaction (i.e., the correlation among features) increases, the quality of representations of explainability tools degrades. For instance, the explainability tool ALE Plot starts to show harsh lines (i.e., zigzag lines) as feature interaction increases. In other words, with more interaction comes a more combined influence in the prediction, induced from different correlated subsets of features (at least two), which ultimately makes it hard to understand the causal relationship between input and output, compared to an individual feature influence in the prediction. In fact, from our study of different explainability tools (e.g., LIME, SHAP, PDP), we have found that the correlation among features is a key stumbling block to represent feature contribution in a model agnostic way. Keeping the issue of feature interactions in mind, (Molnar, Casalicchio, and Bischl 2019) proposes a technique that uses three measures: number of features, interaction strength among\nfeatures, and the main effect (excluding the interaction part) of features to measure the complexity of a post-hoc model for interpretation. Although, their work mainly focuses on model complexity for post-hoc models, that acted as a precursor to formulate our approach of explainability quantification. Our approach to quantify explainability is model agnostic and is for a model of any notion (e.g., pre-modeling, post-hoc)."

      "heading": "3.2 Human Study based Explainability Evaluation",
      "text": "The following work deals with the application- and humanlevel evaluation of explainability involving human studies.\n(Huysmans et al. 2011) investigate the suitability of different alternative representation formats (e.g., decision tables, (binary) decision trees, propositional rules, and oblique rules) for classification tasks primarily focusing on the explainability of results rather than accuracy or precision. They discover that decision tables are the best in terms of accuracy, response time, confidence of answer, and ease of use.\nFurthermore, (Dhurandhar et al. 2017) argue that interpretability is not an absolute concept; rather, it is relative to the target model, and may or may not be relative to the human. Their finding suggests that a model is readily interpretable to a human when it uses no more than seven pieces of information (Miller 1956). Although, this might vary in task to task and person to person. For instance, a domain expert might consume a lot more detail information depending on their experience.\nThe work of (Poursabzi-Sangdeh et al. 2018) is a humancentered approach, focusing on previous work on human trust in a model from psychology, social science, machine learning, and human-computer interaction communities. In their experiment with human subjects, they vary factors (e.g., number of features, whether the model internals is clear or a black box) that makes a model more or less interpretable and measures how the variation impacts the prediction of human subjects. Their result suggests that participants who were shown a clear model with a small number of features were more successful in simulating the model\u2019s predictions and trusted the model\u2019s predictions.\nFurthermore, (Friedler et al. 2019) investigate interpretability of a model based on two of its definitions: simulatability, which is a user\u2019s ability to predict the output of a model on a given input; and \u201dwhat if\u201d local explainability, which is a user\u2019s ability to predict changes in prediction in response to changes in input, given the user has the knowledge of a model\u2019s original prediction for the original input. They introduce a simple metric called runtime operation count that measures the interpretability, that is, the number of operations (e.g., the arithmetic operation for regression, the boolean operation for trees) needed in a user\u2019s mind to interpret something. Their findings suggest that the interpretability decreases with an increase in the number of operations.\n4 Properties of Explanations and Explanation Methods\nAlthough our main interest lies in explainable prediction, it depends on the model that generates the explanations. So, it is crucial to analyze the properties of both the explanation and the explanation method that generates the explanations. (Robnik-S\u030cikonja and Bohanec 2018) and (Molnar and others 2018) attempt to define the properties of explanation methods and individual explanations, which we present in the following sections."

For instance, explanation methods that rely on intrinsically interpretable methods like linear regression are highly translucent; however, counterfactual model agnostic explanation methods that leverage the changes in output in response to input for explanation have zero translucency as it does not look at model at all. The high translucency comes with the possible use of more information to generate the explanation.\n\u2022 Portability: The number of ML models that the explanation method covers.

      "text": "Some properties of individual explanations include: \u2022 Accuracy: The explanation needs to be accurate enough\nwhen fidelity is essential. Although, low accuracy of explanation might be a cause of the low accuracy of the ML/AI model.\n\u2022 Fidelity: How well the explanation approximates the prediction of the black-box model. Usually a highly accurate model with high fidelity leads to highly accurate explanations. Thus, fidelity and accuracy are related.\n\u2022 Consistency: Refers to the extent of consistency among explanations for different ML models on the same task.\n\u2022 Stability: Refers to the extent of similarity of explanations for similar instances. While consistency compares explanations between different models, stability compares the explanations of similar instances for a particular model.\n\u2022 Comprehensibility: The extent to which the recipient of explanation understands the explanation, which is very hard to measure. A few measures could be the number of features with non-zero weights in a linear model, or the number of rules in a tree. Usually a human can comprehend 7+-2 pieces of information at a time (Miller 1956)\n\u2022 Certainty: Many ML models provide the probability of the target class. Similarly, explanations with a certainty value are expected to be useful.\n\u2022 Degree of Importance: How well the explanation covers the important features or how well the explanation reflects parts of the explanations. For example, from the decision rules, we can understand which of the rules are more important (e.g., important features are at the beginning of a ruleset, or the top of the tree). Recent laws (Goodman and Flaxman 2016) (Wyden ) focus on the impact of an algorithmic decision on human rights, interests, and lives. In that sense, we need a humanfriendly explanation, which has slightly different properties than the explanation that does not consider humans as a key factor."

      "heading": "4.3 Properties of Human-friendly Explanation",
      "text": "According to (Miller 2018), humans usually prefer short explanations that contrast the current situation with a situation in which that event would not have occurred (a.k.a., counterfactual explanations). Sometimes abnormal causes provide good explanations. Besides, social context is also important for a good explanation as explanations are a social interaction among the explainer and the recipient of the explanation.\nFurthermore, the human friendly explanation does not consider all factors (i.e., selective in nature) for a particular prediction or behavior. However, if one needs to legally specify all influencing factors or need to debug the machine learning model, there is a need for a complete causal attribution (Molnar and others 2018), which is out of the scope of human-friendly explanation. That is the reason behind mentioning the term qualitative instead of quantitative in our definition of explanation (see Definition of Explainability).\nIn summary, according to (S\u030ctrumbelj and Kononenko 2011), (Miller 2018) (Lipton 1990), and (Molnar and others 2018), human friendly explanations are: contrastive\u2014why a prediction (e.g., loan was rejected) was made instead of another prediction (e.g., loan was accepted), selected\u2014does not cover the complete list of causes of an event, social\u2014social context (e.g., explaining to a layperson or domain expert) determines the nature of the explanations, abnormal behavior focused\u2014when a criteria (e.g., a particular feature value) is rare and has influence in the prediction, then it should be included (i.e., should have higher precedence in case of other criteria with the same influence) in the explanation truthful\u2014explanation should be as truthful as possible, although selectiveness comes first which might exclude some of the true reasons, consistent\u2014consistent with prior belief, and general and probable\u2014good explanations are general and probable, although this contradicts with the claims that abnormal causes make good explanations, abnormal causes have higher preference over general and probable explanations (see abnormal behavior focused point)."

      "heading": "5 Explainability Quantification Method",
      "text": "Usually, humans can relate and process 7+-2 pieces of information (i.e., cognitive chunks) to understand something\n(Miller 1956). For instance, suppose that, in the most generalized form, the quality of an explanation is dependent upon the number of cognitive chunks that the recipient has to relate to in order to understand an explanation (i.e., the less, the better). Lets assume, E = explainability; Nc = number of cognitive chunks; I = interaction; Ni = number of input cognitive chunks; and No = number cognitive chunks involved in the explanation representation (i.e., output cognitive chunks).\nE = 1\nNc (1)\nHowever, sometimes, these cognitive chunks are correlated and their influence/contribution/abilities are not mutually exclusive. This interaction among cognitive chunks complicates the explainability. So we penalize Formula 1 for having an interaction among cognitive chunks, resulting in Formula 2.\nE = 1\nNc + (1\u2212 I) (2)\nWhere, the interaction I ranges in between 0 and 1, and the less the interaction, the better the explainability, so we take the complement of that.\nFormula 2 is in a form that can be applied to any of the application, domain, or proxy level explanation evaluations described before. However, from the perspective of an application and domain level evaluation of explainability, to progress further, we need human studies that are out of the scope of this work. Instead, in this work, we focus on the proxy level evaluation of explainability that considers different properties of output representation (e.g., depth of decision tree, length of rule list) as a metric for evaluation.\nFurthermore, we need to breakdown the number of cognitive chunks more to get a better evaluation. Both the number of input cognitive chunks in the model and the number of output cognitive chunks involved in the representation of output are important to understand the causal relationship, which is vital for explanation. While the ideal explainability case would be when there is only one input and one output cognitive chunk (no chance of interaction), that is unusual in real-world situations. Following the segregation of input and output cognitive chunks, Formula 2 can be re-written as Formulas 3 and 4:\nE = 1\nNc + (1\u2212 I) (3)\nE = 1\nNi +\n1\nNo + (1\u2212 I) (4)\nwhere Ni refers to the number of input cognitive chunks and No refers to the number cognitive chunks involved in the explanation representation (i.e., output cognitive chunks). Usually, the more these cognitive chunks, the more complicated the explanation becomes. So, the ratio of the best case (i.e., one cognitive chunk) and observed case is added towards total explainability.\nAlso, Formula 4 has three predicates, which might have different influences on the quantification of explainability, and different domains might have different implications (e.g., accuracy vs explainability trade off). So, we add a\nweight term with each of the predicates, considering the weights are constant (e.g., .3333) by default, and their summation is equal to 1: w1 + w2 + w3 = 1. However, these weights can be set to a different distribution, perhaps dependant upon a particular domain (e.g., healthcare, finance).\nAfter the addition of the weight terms, Formula 4 becomes Formula 5:\nE = w1 Ni + w2 No + w3(1\u2212 I) (5)\nFormula 5 can then be used to quantify the explainability of the explanation method (i.e., global explainability). We can use Formula 5 to also quantify the explainability of an instance level prediction (i.e., local explainability). In that case, the first predicate of Formula 5 (including the weight term) remains the same (i.e., the same number of input chunks). However, predicate 2 and predicate 3 will be different from instance to instance as a different set of cognitive chunks with different interaction strengths might be involved in the representation of explanation for a particular instance as explanations are selective."

      "text": "We provide a brief overview of the experimental settings of our previous work (Islam et al. 2019) that we will then use for our proposed explainability quantification method. In this example, we incorporate domain knowledge in the model for mortgage bankruptcy prediction, and apply different supervised ML algorithms in three different ways:\n1. Using original features: we use all original features that have a non-zero effect on prediction (features with zero effect were removed in a data pre-processing stage by observing the Random Forest\u2019s feature importance).\n2. Using domain-related features: we select a subset of features that match with extracted domain knowledge (e.g., 5 C\u2019s of credit) from the domain. Traditionally, credit risk is assessed using the 5C\u2019s of credit (character, capital, capacity, collateral, and cycle), a popular domain principle to for determining credit risk. We extract necessary domain knowledge and map to the 5 C\u2019s of credit to get the domain features(Islam et al. 2019).\n3. Using newly constructed features: we construct a very concise set of new features (i.e., five features\u2014one feature for each element of the domain principle 5C\u2019s of credit) from the domain-related features using the quantitative measure of gain/compromises (i.e., the cumulative sum of related feature values times the correlation coefficient) associated with each element of the domain principle. Furthermore, we represent the predicted output as a com-\nposition of individual elements of the domain principle 5C\u2019s of credit(i.e., newly constructed features) (Figure 1).\nOne will notice that the representation (Figure 1) of the prediction in terms of the newly constructed features provides better explainability as the final prediction is segregated into the individual influences of a very concise set of intuitive features (i.e., five compared to 30). However, there is no way to quantify the level of perceived explainability. To use our proposed formula in this work (Formula 5) to\nquantify explainability, we need to calculate the interaction strength (I) too. We measure the interaction strength among features using R\u2019s iml package that uses the partial dependence of an individual features as the basis for calculating interaction strength (I).\nApplying Formula 5, on metadata (Table 1) of three different feature settings, we see that newly constructed features (5\u2019C of credit) provide the best explainability score of .2723, which is an improvement of 60.14% compared to the 0.17 that we get using the original features (Table 1). In fact, even if we apply the state-of-the-art methods of post-hoc interpretability/explainability like SHAP, the explainability will be still limited to 0.17 as it does not reduce the number of cognitive chunks to represent output. Besides, using domain related features, the explainability score is .2538, which is better than using the original features, although a little worse than using the newly constructed features.\nFurthermore, this explainability gain comes with a negligible cost of performance (Figure 2, Figure 3) which is expected and a known trade off for explainability methods. In\nfact, for a few algorithms (e.g., Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB)), the newly constructed features, and domain related features lead to better recall, which is crucial for anomaly detection where the target class instances are very few compared to non-target class instances. In that sense, besides a better explainability, the domain knowledge benefits us in terms of different performance (e.g., better recall, less features leads to less computation time) measures too."

      "text": "Explainable decisions from commercial AI systems are going to be a standard imposed by regulators to eliminate bias and discrimination, and ensure trust. Our work attempts to establish a concrete definition of explainability, properties of explanations and explanation methods, and a way to quantify explainability which is transferable to a variety of explainability methods or tools. For the quantification of explainability, we only present an approach for the proxy method. In the future, we would like to address human studies as an extension of this work."
