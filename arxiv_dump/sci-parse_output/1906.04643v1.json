A recent study from Oxford Economics and ServiceNow showed that 51% of CIOs cite data quality as a substantial barrier to their company\u2019s adoption of AI (Service-Now, 2018). Even academic research (Tommasi et al., 2015; Torralba & Efros, 2017) has shown that data can significantly affect the performance of a machine learning system.\nWith growing concerns from customers and policy-makers about AI being a blackbox technology, the aforementioned problem gets even more aggravated. Consider, for example, an AI-based credit scoring system. In markets where credit risk scoring models are regulated and scrutinized, the AI models and credit decisions derived from them are strongly monitored and regulated to be explainable to lenders, regulators and consumers (FICO, 2018). While there have been several initiatives both from the government (Gunning, 2017) and a diverse set of industries (Kyndi, 2018; PWC, 2018) to make AI explainable, most state-of-the-art methods continue to provide explanations that mostly target the needs of AI engineers (Selvaraju et al., 2017).\nThus, there exists a gap between the explanations that are provided by AI models, and the explanations sought by various stakeholders. While there could be several factors that contribute to this gap, data is a significant contributor. In this paper, we explore strategies by which we might be able to bridge this gap. We discuss the process of curating datasets that serve the needs of stakeholders beyond AI scientists, and share the insights gained therein.\nMotivated by the widespread adoption of AI in the Fintech industry, for the purposes of this study, we consider the usecase of explaining AI based loan decisions . From regulators, judges, and credit bureaus, to bank managers, investment stakeholders, and loan applicants, a variety of stakeholders may be in need of an explanation.\nDepending on the role of the human-in-the-loop, the purpose an explanation should serve varies. For example, an AI scientist might want an explanation to understand what is the best debugging strategy if the model fails, or might want an explanation to know that the model is working as required, i.e. for validation purposes. Thus, an explanation such as \u201cPerson A was denied a loan because their profile\nwas similar to person B who was also denied a loan\u201d might be useful to the AI scientist in validating the model. But this kind of an explanation little helps a loan applicant!\nA loan applicant, on the other hand, might want to know why they were denied the loan and perhaps what they can do to secure a future loan. Thus, the purpose of the explanation might be to educate the loan applicant or help them take appropriate action to secure a future loan.\nThus, some purposes of explanation could include:\n\u2022 To educate the user\n\u2022 To engender trust in the user\n\u2022 To provide actionable insights to the user\n\u2022 To provide insights regarding system design and debugging\nSurprisingly, most XAI methods focus on serving the needs of AI engineers in system debugging, and this contributes significantly to the gap between explanations provided by AI models and those sought by end users.\nIn addition to serving the needs of the human-in-the-loop seeking the explanation (i.e. the explainee), an explanation should be presented in a simple and friendly manner. For example, existing datasets to train AI models for loan decisions contain features such as \u201cexternal risk estimate, risk performance, trades with high utilization ratio\u201d, etc. Our study indicates that these factors are not helpful in justifying loan denials to applicants. Rather, users find specific factors concerning credit (no credit, limited credit, limited credit history), job (unstable job, unstable job history, no job), income (low income, no income) and debt (current debt, loan history) comprehensible and therefore acceptable.\nSpecifically, the objective of the study was two-fold.\n\u2022 We wanted to curate a dataset that would aid in the creation of AI models which are capable of generating loan applicant friendly explanations such as those in (Srinivasan et al., 2018).\n\u2022 We also wanted the dataset to include explanations that serve a purpose\u2014 explanations that educate the loan applicant about loan denial, and help them take appropriate actions to secure a future loan.\nIn the next section, we describe the process of curating the dataset.\n2.

Snapshot", "text": "The dataset was curated from surveys conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) across multiple rounds in order to arrive at a reliable and valid set of responses. The use case was the same across all surveys: a loan applicant is seeking a $12000 loan from a bank to purchase a car. The bank uses an AI system to determine if the loan applicant is a good candidate. In this case, the applicant was denied the loan and is now seeking an explanation for how this decision was reached. The task of the AMT workers was to provide up to 10 explanations to the candidate the details of which is provided below."}, {"heading": "Data Collection", "text": "\u2022 Data collected by means of survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)\n\u2022 AMT workers were provided with a loan application scenario and asked to imagine that they were loan applicants\n\u2022 Workers provided textual descriptions highlighting reasons for loan denials"}, {"heading": "Data Labeling", "text": "The collected responses from AMT workers were edited for syntactic and semantic correctness by linguists.

An analysis revealed that there were some high level reasons or broad categories of loan denials, and within each of those broad categories, several sub-categories could be identified.\n\u2022 A total of 2432 responses were divided into broad categories (e.g., job) and subcategories (e.g., unstable job, no job) for loan denial.\n\u2022 The analysis yielded a total of 16 major categories each of which contained 2-7 sub-categories. A total of 60 unique loan denial reasons were thereby identified."}, {"heading": "Expanding Explanations along Purpose Dimensions", "text": "As outlined in the second objective, the next task in curating the dataset was to incorporate explanations that help educate the loan applicant about the denial, and to help them take appropriate action to secure a future loan. While the survey results offered a diversity of ways to express the explanations, we re-phrased those explanations, not only for the purposes of clarity, but also for the purposes of expressing\nsympathy and caring to the user. This, in turn, would facilitate the creation of a friendly channel of communication for educating and guiding them. Some illustrations are provided in Table 1.\n\u2022 Explanations that educate the loan applicant\n\u2022 Explanations that help the loan applicant take an appropriate action towards future loan approval\nIn the next section, we provide details concerning survey designs."}, {"heading": "2.2. Survey Development", "text": "We varied the details that we provided to the survey respondents in order to obtain a range of useful explanations. In Survey 1, we provided specific details about the applicant. By providing these specific details, we hoped to provide a realistic portrait of the loan applicant that would inspire the survey responses. However, we quickly found that most of the responses focused solely on the information we had provided.\nSurvey 1 (10 participants) Unique survey feature: Provided specific details about the loan applicant (e.g. $ 28000 annual income) Observations: Responses were too biased towards the information provided about the applicant\nTo rectify this, we developed Survey 2 which replaced the specific details of the applicant with five broad categories of features that the AI might use in making its decision (e.g. credit score, annual income, etc.). However, we found again that the responses were heavily biased towards the features provided.\nSurvey 2 (50 participants) Unique survey feature: Provided examples of features (broad categories such as credit history, etc.) that the AI might use in reaching its decision without listing specific numbers as in Survey 1. Observations: Responses were biased by the features listed with no additional reasons for denial provided.\nWe therefore developed Survey 3 which eliminated both the specifics about the applicant and the sample features. As we hoped, the answers were unbiased and diverse across a number of categories.\nSurvey 3 (50 participants) Unique survey feature: Provided no information about the applicant or the possible features that the AI model could use. Observations: Responses were diverse with many unique explanations provided.\nThe final version of the survey, Survey 4, was identical to Survey 3 with the exception that we asked respondents to provide both good (i.e., useful) and poor (i.e., not useful) explanations. We added the poor explanations to learn about any additional explanation characteristics that might emerge from this category.\nSurvey 4 (Final) (200 participants) Unique survey feature: Same as Survey 3 but respondents were asked to provide examples of both good and poor explanations Observations: Responses were diverse across both good and poor explanations. This survey version was adopted for collecting the data.\nWe discovered 16 broad categories of explanation. This qualitative annotation could serve as the input for training the AI models.\nIn the next section, we summarize some of the findings of the study.\n3. What we learned\nThe study revealed some interesting aspects.\n\u2022 Existing datasets to train explainable AI models contain features that are mostly incomprehensible by end users. Furthermore, existing datasets seldom contained features that users considered acceptable in understanding a model\u2019s decision. For example, in understanding loan denials, users considered features such as assets, income, debt, etc. as acceptable. These features are hardly present in typical machine learning datasets to determine loan denials.\n\u2022 Different people have different views of the same world. These subjective viewpoints, get baked into the dataset and, in turn, into the kind of explanations they seek. As long as these are valid reasons, these diverse viewpoints are essential to address the needs of various kinds of users. Incorporation of various viewpoints improves diversity of the dataset.\n\u2022 As a consequence of the aforementioned point, there are often several explanations that appear only once in the dataset reflecting the viewpoints of certain individuals only. This kind of a data distribution poses challenges to machine learning algorithms due to sparsity of data points.\n\u2022 Crowdsourcing data comes with its own challenges. The data has to be cleaned for semantic and syntactic correctness and labeled. This would involve another set of expert humans in the loop. In order to maintain consistency amongst the annotators, certain rules had to be established in editing and annotating. First, we\ndecided to discard responses that were not well formed (for example, \u201cthe loan was denied because the applicant is poor\u201d is not a well formed reason as it lacks the necessary details about what it means by being poor), or those that were biased (for example, \u201cthe loan was denied because the applicant is a woman\u201d). For editing, certain explanation structures were adopted. Based on studies from cognitive science, we incorporated a few explanation structures (Keil, 2006) that are proven to be helpful to the explainee. For example, explanations were structured as if-then rules (for example, if the annual income is less than x, then a loan cannot be granted) and as causal patterns (for example, the loan is denied because the applicant\u2019s credit score is too low). The annotators then would re-frame each response based on those rules.\n4. What we recommend\nIn order to bridge the gap between research and practice, and to accelerate the practical adoption of AI across a variety of domains, we suggest:\n\u2022 Adoption of a user-centered approach in generating explanations (rather than model-based approaches): In other words, explanations need to serve a variety of users and therefore have to be designed in a way that no domain knowledge may be necessary. This, in turn, would mean that the reasons used in the explanation should be easily comprehensible by various stakeholders involved.\n\u2022 Understanding of the explanation context: who is seeking explanation, what is the purpose of the explanation, etc. Explanations are meant to bridge the knowledge gap between the person providing the explanation (explainer), and the person seeking it (explainee). Furthermore, explanations should serve a purpose. This could be in educating the user, in engendering trust in the user, in helping with system debugging, to guide the user in taking appropriate actions, etc. Thus, it is important to design explanations keeping in mind the human-inthe-loop seeking it, and the purpose an explanation is\ntrying to serve.\n\u2022 Creation of new datasets aligned along the lines of aforementioned points As already described, features in existing machine learning datasets are not necessarily user friendly. Creating new datasets that are representative of userfriendly features to train new AI models is therefore beneficial. In creating such datasets, it is very much possible that one may encounter unfamiliar or uncommon explanations for a particular use case. It is important to include these uncommon responses as long as they are valid in order to capture diversity and to address the needs of various kinds of users.\n\u2022 Design of new algorithms to cater to the limitations of datasets As a consequence of creating user friendly datasets, certain use-cases may not have ample training data. In such scenarios, new algorithms may have to be designed to handle limited training data."}, {"heading": "5.
