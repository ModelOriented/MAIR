Recent work on Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) proposed directional derivatives to quantify the influence of user-defined concepts on the network output. As a real application example, the presence of diagnostic concepts such as microaneurysms and aneurysms was used to explain network predictions for diabetic retinopaty levels [6]. However, diagnostic concepts are often continuous measures that might be counter intuitive to describe by their presence or absence.\nIntense research on network interpretability defined the distinction between global and local interpretability and proposed a taxonomy of desiderata, methods and evaluation criteria [1,10,12]. The relevance, or saliency, of input factors to the network decision was proposed in several gradient-based methods [12,14,15,16]. Outputs of these methods are typically local explanations that are gathered in attribution maps and overlayed to the original input image. The interpretability of these approaches, however, was shown to be limited and often inconsistent [7,13]. Research in the linearity of the latent space showed that linear classifiers can\nProceedings of the First International Workshop of Interpretability of Machine Intelligence in Medical Image Computing at MICCAI 2018, Granada, Spain, September 16-20, 2018.

These directions were mapped to semantic word embeddings in [11] or human-friendly visual concepts in [6]. TCAV computes the direction representative of a concept as the normal to the hyperplane which separates a set of concept images from a set of random images. The TCAV score estimates the influence of the user-defined concept on network decisions [6].\nIn this paper, we extend TCAV from a classification problem to a regression problem by computing Regression Concept Vectors (RCVs). Instead of seeking a discriminator between two concepts (or one concept and random inputs), we seek the direction of greatest increase of the measures for a single continuous concept. In particular, we compute RCVs by least squares linear regression of the concept measures for a set of inputs. We measure the relevance of a concept with bidirectional relevance scores, Br. The Br scores assume positive values when increasing values of the concept measures positively affect classification and negative in the opposite case.\nWe address breast cancer histopathology as an application for functionally grounded evaluation. The classification of high-resolution patches as tumorous and non-tumorous tissue is often used as a first step by state-of-the-art breast cancer classifiers [3]. Identifying the factors relevant to classification is essential to improve the physicians\u2019 trust in automated grading. For this reason, we referred to the Nottingham Histologic Grading system (NHG) [2] to select nuclear pleomorphism, and especially variations in nuclei size, shape and texture as concept measures.\nThe main contributions of this paper are (i) the expression of concept measures as RCVs; (ii) the development and evaluation of Br scores; (iii) the computation of nuclei pleomorphism relevance for breast cancer.\nIn the following, we clarify the notations adopted in the paper. We consider the set {xi, yi}Ni=1 of inputs and ground truth pairs and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for binary classification with prediction output f(xi) \u2208 [0, 1]. The input xi is a 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 image patch and yi \u2208 {0, 1} is the corresponding class label (with y = 1 for the tumor class). The disjoint set {xj , cj}Kj=1 is representative of a concept C, with measures cj \u2208 IR for each image sample xj . In the activation space, the output of layer l for input xi is \u03a6\nl(xi) and the RCV for C is \u2212\u2192v lC (we will drop superscript l to simplify the notation). An overview of the method is presented in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Correlation to Network Prediction", "text": "As a prior analysis, we compute the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient \u03c1 between cj and f(xj) for j = 1, ..,K. If cj is not relevant for f(xj), their correlation should be low. In this case, \u03a6l(xj) should not encode information about cj and it should be unlikely to find a good linear regression. A high correlation could instead suggest a positive (if \u03c1 > 0) or negative (\u03c1 < 0) influence of the concept on the prediction."}, {"heading": "2.2 Regression Concept Vectors", "text": "We extract and flatten the \u03a6l(xj) for each xj . The RCV \u2212\u2192v C is the vector in the space of the activation that best fits the direction of the strongest increase of the concept measures. This direction can be computed as the least squares linear regression fit of {\u03a6l(xj), cj}Kj=1 (see Figure 1). In the NHG, for example, larger nuclei are assigned higher grades by pathologists. If we take nuclei area as a concept, we seek the vector in the activation space that points towards representations of larger nuclei."}, {"heading": "2.3 Sensitivity to RCV", "text": "For each testing pair (xi, yi) we compute the sensitivity score S l C,i as the directional derivative along the direction of the RCV:\nSlC,i = \u2202f(xi) \u2202\u03a6l(xi) \u00b7 \u2212\u2192v C (1)\nSlC,i represents the network sensitivity to changes in the input along the direction of increasing values of the concept measures. When moving along this direction, f(xi) may either increase, decrease or remain unchanged (S l C,i=0). The sign of SlC,i represents the direction of change, while the magnitude of S l C,i represents the rate of change. TCAV computes global explanations from the N sensitivities although it does not consider their magnitude. Hence, we propose\nBr as an alternative measure. Br scores were formulated by taking into account the principles of explanation continuity and selectivity proposed in [12]. For the former, we consider whether the sensitivity scores are similar for similar data samples. For the latter, we redistribute the final relevance to concepts with the strongest impact on the decision function. We define Br scores as the ratio between the coefficient of determination of the least squares regression, R2, and the coefficient of variation \u03c3\u0302/\u00b5\u0302 of the N sensitivity scores:\nBr = R2 \u00d7 ( \u00b5\u0302\n\u03c3\u0302\n) (2)\nR2 \u2264 1 indicates how closely the RCV fits the {\u03a6l(xi), ci}Ni=1. The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation of the scores over their average, and describes their relative variation around the mean. For the same value of R2, the Br for spread scores is lower than for scores that lay closely concentrated near their sample mean. After computing Br for multiple concepts, we scale the scores to the range [-1, 1] by dividing by the maximum absolute value."}, {"heading": "2.4 Evaluation of the Explanations", "text": "The explanations are evaluated on the basis of their statistical significance as proposed in [6].

We report the per-patch validation accuracy for both models, although details about the training setup in [3] are unknown. Bootstrapping of the false positives was not performed and the training set size was kept limited (with 40K patches instead of 600K). The obtained accuracy is sufficient for a meaningful model interpretation analysis, which may be used to boost the network accuracy and generalization. Besides this, the analysis could itself be used as an alternative to bootstrapping for detecting mislabeled examples [8].\nCorrelation Analysis We expressed the NHG criteria for nuclei pleomorphism as average statistics of the nuclei morphology and texture features. From the patches (xj) with ground truth segmentation, we computed average nuclei area, Euler coefficient and eccentricity of the ellipses that have the same secondmoments as the nuclei segmented contours. We extracted three Haralick texture features inside the segmented nuclei, namely Angular Second Moment (ASM), contrast and correlation [4]. The Pearson correlation between the concept measurements and the relative network prediction is shown in Table 2. The concept measures for contrast had the largest correlation coefficient, \u03c1 = 0.41.\nAre We Learning the Concepts? The performance of the linear regression was used to check if the network is learning the concepts and in which layers. The determination coefficient of the regression R2 expresses the percentage of variation that is captured by the regression. We computed R2 for all xj patches over multiple reruns to analyze the learning dynamics. Almost all the concepts were learned in the early layers of the network (see Figure 2a), with eccentricity and Euler being the only two exceptions. Figure 2b shows that the concept Euler is highly unstable and has almost zero mean, suggesting that the learned RCVs might be random directions.\nSensitivity and Relevance Sensitivity scores were computed on N = 300 patches (xi) from Camelyon17. The global relevance was tested with TCAV and Br, as reported in Figure 3. Contrast is relevant for the classification, with TCAV= 0.75 and Br = 0.25. Even stronger is the impact of correlation, which shifts the classification output towards the non-tumor class. In this case sensitivies are mostly negative, with Br = \u22121 and TCAV= 0.1. These scores mirror the preliminary analysis of Pearson correlation in Table 2. Unstable concepts, such as Euler and eccentricity, lead to almost zero Br scores, in accordance with the initial hypothesis that the RCVs for these concepts might just be random vectors.\nStatistical Evaluation We performed a two-tailed t-test to compare the distributions of the scores against the null hypothesis of learning a random direction for the TCAV (mean 0.5) and Br (mean 0) scores. The results are presented in Table 3. There was a significant difference (with p-value \u2264 0.01) in the scores for all the relevant concepts, namely correlation, ASM, area and contrast. The statistical significance of correlation improves for Br scores. From the sensitivity\nand relevance analysis, we do not expect the Euler and eccentricity concepts to be statistically different from random directions. The analysis of both TCAV and Br scores confirms this hypothesis (p-value \u2264 0.01) for the eccentricity, although the confidence to not reject the null hypothesis is higher with Br. The Euler concept is not rejected by the TCAV analysis. Br scores, instead, reject the hypothesis of this score being relevant."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "RCVs showed that nuclei contrast and correlation were relevant to the classification of patches of breast tissue. This is in accordance with the NHG grading system, which identifies hyperchromatism as a signal of nuclear atypia. Extending the set of analyzed concepts can lead to the identification of other relevant concepts. RCVs can give insights about network training. The learning of the concepts across layers is linked to the size of the receptive field of the neurons\nand the increasing complexity of the sought patterns (see Fig. 2 and [6]). Hence, more abstract concepts, potentially useful in other applications, can be learned and analyzed in deep layers of the network. Moreover, outliers in the values of the sensitivity scores can identify challenging training inputs or highlight domain mismatches (e.g. differences across hospitals, staining techniques, etc.).\nOverall, this paper proposed a definition of RCVs and a proof of concept on breast cancer data. RCVs could be extended to many other tasks and application domains. In the computer vision domain, RCVs could also express higher-level concepts such as materials, objects and scenes. In signal processing tasks, RCVs could be used, for instance, to determine the relevance of the occurrence of a keyword in topic modeling, or of a phoneme in automatic speech recognition.\nAcknowledgements This work was possible thanks to the project PROCESS, part of the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 777533)."}], "title": "Regression Concept Vectors for Bidirectional Explanations in Histopathology", "year": 2019}
