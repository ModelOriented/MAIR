INTRODUCTION\u00a0 \u00a0 Motivation\u00a0 \u00a0\nWith every passing day, traffic snarls at major junctions are posing a great problem to roadway commuters.

In any case, not many\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 productions in the current writing handle this issue by means of automatic intelligent systems, and, when they do, they focus on\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 limited areas with elementary traffic light schedules. Hence, the pressing need for a context aware traffic management system is\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 increasingly growing.
