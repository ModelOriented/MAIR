      "text": "Cricket is a worldwide popular game where a single delivery can change the fate of the game. Every delivery is counted as a crucial moment for both teams. Umpires make the decisions regarding a no ball. Different technologies are being used to help the umpires to take their decisions. But often due to human perception, deciding whether a bowled delivery is a no ball or legal ball makes controversies. So, it is very important to make an accurate decision regarding a no ball.\nOne of the most common reason is a waist-high full toss. A full toss is a delivery that reaches to the batsman without bouncing on the pitch first. However, a waist-high full toss is permissible from a slower bowler as long as it does not go above the batsman\u2019s shoulder. If it does, then the umpire calls it a no ball. Television replays are being used to make the examination of this kind of delivery. So, umpires make their\ndecision on their perception. But their perception cannot be accurate at all time as they are human. Besides, it is not always possible to make the accurate judgment regarding a no-ball using existing technologies. As a result, some doubts are created and the benefit goes to the batting team.\nIn cricket, it is challenging to develop such technology that can able to decide the waist-high no-ball in real time with higher accuracy. But in our research, we used a pertained model inception- v3 that uses different convolutional neural network`s layer to give a high degree of accuracy on the decision. Our proposed method is expected to perform better and low cost in operating due to no infield sensor and other devices. As umpires are responsible for deciding a no-ball so, many scenarios are created when a delivery is disapproved by umpires and some scenarios are declared a no-ball. As a consequence of no-ball, opposite team gets an extra run and delivery and also the batsman will not be given out except running out. Sometimes the umpire's decision makes controversies as they make a decision using television replays. In our system, we tried to end all these controversies and make a good result. Our goal is to measure the probability of an image either it is a no-ball or not, to make the automated umpiring system and to eliminate the shortcoming of human perception."

Facing the problem of collecting enough training data to rebuild models, transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge from a large dataset known as source domain to a smaller dataset named target domain. Either the feature spaces between domain data are different or the source tasks and the target tasks focus on different topics, boosting the performance of the target task. Transfer learning using CNN's is commonly used in different fields."

Using transfer learning sensor flow provides tutorials for us to retrain Inception\u2019s final layer new categories. Transfer learning method keeps the parameters of the previous layer and remove the last of the Inception-v3 model and then retrain the last layer. The number of categories in the dataset is equal to the number of output nodes in the last layer just like ImageNet dataset which has 1000 classes, so the last layer has 1000 output nodes in the original Inception-v3 model."

      "text": "Convolution layer extract feature from an input image[4]. A convolutional operation is performed to the input and then passes the result to the next layer. Using small squares of input data, convolution learns image features and preserves the spatial relationship between pixels. CONV layer\u2019s parameters are made of a set\nof learnable filters. Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume.\nRectified linear unit or ReLU is the activation function which is commonly used in deep learning networks for hidden layers[4]. The function returns 0 if the input is less than 0 and if the input is greater than 0 then the output is equal to the input. Its derivative is either 0 or 1. When the input is positive the derivate is just 1 so there is no squeezing effect on back propagated errors. It can be written as,\n\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = max(0, \ud835\udc65)\nWhere x is the input to a neuron.\nPooling or down sampling reduces the dimensionality of each sub-region but saves the most significant information[4,14]. Pooling layer is inserted in-between every consecutive Conv. layers in convolutional neural network architecture. Max pooling is generally used to reduce the dimensionality and get the highest element of each sub-region. Max pooling uses the maximum value from each sub-region of every node at the previous layer. Max pooling discards 75% of the activations and controlling overfitting.\nFully Connected layers are not defined by the number of nodes, just by how they are connected to adjacent layer`s nodes[4,14]. The fully connected layer also introduced by Dense layers used in classification adding previous layer neurons to every neuron on the next layer.\nDifferent types of function like Softmax activation function[14], SVM, and many others are used here for high-level reasoning in the neural network. Let us consider a classification model to classify with n classes. This model takes input datasets and an algorithm and produces a score of each class. The Softmax activation function converts from score to the probability between 0 to 1.the summation of all probabilities is 1.we used this function to the final layer of convolutional neural networks to classify the classes. This function is produced by multiple class from an input array. The probability distribution of Softmax function is:\nWhere i=1, 2, 3 \u2026.n and j=1, 2, 3 \u2026.n\nCross-entropy loss, or log loss[4], measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverge from the actual label. In our classification tasks to classify no-ball based on images of no-ball, a very common type of loss function to use is Cross Entropy loss. It is defined as\n\ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5d [\u2212log\ud835\udc5e] = \ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udc5d) + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc59 (\ud835\udc5d||\ud835\udc5e)\nWhere H (p) is the entropy of p. \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc59 (\ud835\udc5d||\ud835\udc5e) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence of q from p."

For action recognition, they use 3D MACH to classify the shots and to detect cricket shots they define 8 classes of angle ranges[2].\nAnother cricket shot classification using computer vision proposed by AZM Ehtesham Chowdhury and Abu Umair Jihan divided the approach into four phases of identifying batsman\u2019s hand stroke direction, tracking, detection of a collision of bat and ball and detection of human pose and skeleton joints[3].\nKalpit Dixit and Anusha Balakrishnan compare the performance of three different Convolutional Neural Networks to classify ball-by-ball outcomes for sports videos. They use a pre-trained VGG16 Net to classify each ball into four different outcomes and the prediction accuracy is 80%[4].\nIn another research paper, Nikhil Batra, Harsh Gupta, Nakul Yadav, Anshika Gupta and Amita Yadav proposed a multi-valued automated decision whether a ball is no-ball or wide ball[5].

We applied Cross Validation Technique and portioned our final dataset into 10 equal subsamples to get a higher accuracy.\nResult of our whole simulation is shown in Table 1. We used 100 images as test set each time for cross-validation. We have got the final average accuracy of 88% which is a fairly good one. It indicates high number of True Positives and lower number of False Positives and False Negatives.\nFrom, Fig 5 we can see that, while training the data, we got the highest training accuracy of 94% while the highest validation accuracy achieved is 90%. It is noteworthy that this data was acquired from the 9th epoch of the Cross Validation which performed the highest.\nFrom Fig 6, we can infer that, our cross-entropy for training set declined to the\npoint as low as 0.37 the cross-entropy for validation set declined to the point as low\nas 0.35 which is moderately fair. From both of the above presented figures, we can\nalso infer that, the dataset had a lot of random noises or distortions which caused\nthe sudden spikes in the training accuracy graphs. This is due to the synthetic\nnature of the used dataset which was error-prone.\nTable1. Measure Accuracy based on confusion matrix.\nachieved a pretty good Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F-Measure value with very low False Positive Rate (FPR).\n6 Future Works\nIn our proposed method to detect waist high full toss no-ball in a cricket match, we have used convolution neural networks to build a model from our image dataset without using any sensors in a field. Our system can be used to detect others type of no-ball corresponding to waist high full toss no-ball and leg before wicket(lbw) detection and wide ball detection. In future, we want to develop an automated umpiring system based on computer vision application."

      "text": "In this paper, we measure the probability of an image either it is a no-ball or not using softmax. Training a Convolutional Neural Network using pre-trained Inception-V3 can show great outcome to classify cricket images. We use 900 images to train our model and retrained Inception-V3\u2019s final layer. Then we test the retrained model using an image which gives the probability of no ball or legal ball. We used the cross-validation technique in this model and get the accuracy of 88% which is more than expectation. Using this model we eliminated the shortcoming of Umpire\u2019s perception to decide a waist-high full toss no-ball. Corresponding to many no ball detection approaches and applications, our approach is more effective and efficient."
